SYNOPSIS
Title
Phase 2 Study of Carboplatin, Etoposide, and Atezolizumab With or
Without Trilaciclib (G1T28) in Patients with Untreated Extensive-Stage
Small Cell Lung Cancer
Study Rationale
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all
lung cancer cases worldwide and more than two-thirds of patients present
with extensive-stage disease. Although response rates to first-line
chemotherapy in extensive-stage SCLC are in the range of 50% to 60%,
the median duration of response is short (approximately 4 months), with a
median survival of 8 to 10 months and 2-year survival rates of less than
10%. Increasing evidence suggests that immune responses against SCLC
cells make immunotherapy a viable therapeutic approach in this disease.
Furthermore, there is evidence that certain chemotherapeutic regimens
may augment the immunotherapeutic response in SCLC, in part by
releasing neoantigens and educating the immune system against the
surviving cancer cells.
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®), is a monoclonal antibody that binds to
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), inhibiting its interaction with the
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor and releasing the
PD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response. Atezolizumab
is an immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (approved in the United States in
May 2016) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (approved
in the United States in October 2016). Etoposide and carboplatin (E/P) is a
standard SCLC treatment and is currently under investigation with
atezolizumab for the treatment of SCLC.
The major drawback to platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens used
in SCLC treatment is dose-limiting myelosuppression, which may
antagonize the intended effects of the immunotherapy by reducing both
the number and function of lymphocytes. Therefore, an approach to
maintain immune system function while administering cytotoxic
chemotherapy is needed to fully realize the therapeutic potential of
immunotherapies.
Trilaciclib (G1T28) is a highly potent, selective, and reversible
cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor in development to
preserve bone marrow and immune system function (including lymphoid
progenitors and lymphocytes) from damage by chemotherapy, allowing
faster hematopoietic recovery, preserving long-term bone marrow
function, and enhancing the antitumor activity of chemotherapy.
Trilaciclib is administered intravenously prior to every dose of
chemotherapy in every cycle, eg, on Days 1 to 3 prior to E/P
administration in 21-day cycles, for extensive-stage SCLC. This pulsatile
dosing around chemotherapy administration allows preservation of the
bone marrow and immune system without adding to the
chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression caused by chronic inhibition of
CDK4/6 in the bone marrow.
To evaluate the effect of trilaciclib in combination with chemotherapy and

an immune checkpoint inhibitor, immunocompetent MC38 tumor-bearing
mice were treated with trilaciclib, oxaliplatin, or anti-PD-L1 alone or in
combination, and tumor size was measured during and after treatment for
100 days. The addition of trilaciclib to an oxaliplatin/anti-PD-L1
combination (TOP) treatment significantly improved the overall response
rate, complete response rate, and median overall survival (OS) compared
to oxaliplatin/anti-PD-L1 combination (93% vs 46%; 79% vs 38%; not
reached at 100 days vs 59 days, respectively). Taken together, this
demonstrates that trilaciclib, which has been shown to preserve immune
function during chemotherapy, enhances the antitumor activity of
chemotherapy/anti-PD-L1 combination therapy.
In summary, nonclinical data demonstrate that trilaciclib administration
with chemotherapy preserves bone marrow and immune system function
from damage by chemotherapy and enhances the antitumor activity of
chemotherapy/anti-PD-L1 combination therapy. Additionally, preliminary
clinical data suggest that lymphocyte numbers are relatively unchanged
when trilaciclib is used in combination with chemotherapy. Preserving
adaptive immunity with trilaciclib may enhance the efficacy of
chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, supporting
clinical testing of the novel combination of etoposide, carboplatin, and
atezolizumab (E/P/A) therapy and trilaciclib.

E/P/A) cycles, patients will proceed to the maintenance part of the study
and receive atezolizumab every 21 days. Study drug refers to trilaciclib or
placebo + E/P/A during the induction part and atezolizumab during the
maintenance part. Treatment in both parts will continue until disease
progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or
discontinuation by investigator. Following disease progression per
RECIST v1.1, if the patient appears to be deriving clinical benefit, the
investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient, and the patient
has provided re-consent, study drug administration may be continued until
loss of clinical benefit. The study includes 3 phases: Screening Phase,
Treatment Phase (induction part + maintenance part), and Survival
Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase begins on the day of first dose
with study treatment and completes after the last Post-Treatment Visit.
Randomization will be stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) and presence of brain
metastases (yes versus no).
Criteria for Subsequent Cycles and Study Duration
Study drug administration will continue for up to
4 chemotherapy-containing (trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A) cycles during
the induction part of the study and atezolizumab will be administered
every 21 days during the maintenance part of the study. Study drug
administration will continue until disease progression per RECIST v1.1,
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation by
investigator, whichever occurs first. However, if the patient appears to be
deriving clinical benefit, the investigator believes it is in the best interest
of the patient, and the patient has provided re-consent, study drug
administration may be continued until loss of clinical benefit. Treatment
cycles will occur consecutively without interruption, except when
necessary to manage toxicities or for administrative reasons as described
below.
In order to start Induction Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles as scheduled
during the induction part, patients must have an absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelet count ≥100 × 109/L, and nonhematologic
drug-related toxicities (except alopecia) must be ≤Grade 1 or have
returned to baseline. A delay of > 9 weeks for recovery from any toxicity
related to trilaciclib or placebo + E/P in order to meet the continuation
criteria will result in discontinuation of trilaciclib or placebo + E/P. A
delay of > 15 weeks for recovery and management of immune-related
toxicities attributed to atezolizumab (12 weeks for recovery to ≤Grade 1
and up to an additional 3 weeks for steroid taper of oral prednisone or
equivalent to ≤10 mg/day) will result in discontinuation of atezolizumab.
If patients meet the criteria for starting the subsequent cycle, a delay of up
to 2 weeks is permitted for administrative reasons (eg, holiday, vacation,
etc.); however, a total delay of more than 9 weeks for trilaciclib or
placebo + E/P, or 15 weeks for atezolizumab must be discussed with the
medical monitor. If the subsequent cycle is delayed, the patient should
still complete the clinical laboratory assessments, the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Lung quality of life instrument
(FACT-L), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Anemia
quality of life instrument (FACT-An) questionnaires on the scheduled

Day 1, as well as on the actual first dosing day of the next cycle.
Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following:
infusion-related reactions (IRRs); immune-related hepatitis, pneumonitis,
colitis, pancreatitis; diabetes mellitus; hypothyroidism; hyperthyroidism;
adrenal insufficiency; Guillain-Barré syndrome; myasthenic syndrome or
myasthenia gravis; hypophysitis; and meningoencephalitis. In addition,
systemic immune activation is a potential risk associated with
atezolizumab when given in combination with other immunomodulating
agents. Refer to the Atezolizumab Guidance for the Investigator
(Appendix 1) for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for
atezolizumab and their management.
Management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) attributed to
atezolizumab may include administration of immunosuppressant
medications like corticosteroids, etc.; delay of a scheduled dose; or
discontinuation of therapy. No dose reductions will be allowed for
atezolizumab. Atezolizumab dosing will be held in the event of any irAEs
attributed to atezolizumab until the event has improved to ≤Grade 1. See
the Atezolizumab Guidance for the Investigator (Appendix 1).
Other irAEs attributed to atezolizumab not listed above should be
assessed by the investigator and discussed with the medical monitor to
determine if atezolizumab should be held or discontinued. If the irAE
does not improve to ≤Grade 1 within 12 weeks, treatment will be
permanently discontinued.
Discontinuation or interruption of trilaciclib or placebo + E/P does not
preclude continuation of atezolizumab and vice versa. For instance, if an
adverse event (AE) is attributed to trilaciclib or placebo, etoposide, or
carboplatin (eg, hematologic toxicity) during the induction part of the
study, then atezolizumab will be continued while the trilaciclib or placebo
+ E/P are held. While the trilaciclib or placebo + E/P are held, the patient
will continue to receive atezolizumab, be monitored for safety, and will
begin the next trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A-containing induction cycle
after the toxicity resolves. If the AE is immune related and attributed to
atezolizumab; then trilaciclib or placebo + E/P will be continued for up to
4 cycles while the atezolizumab is held. After discontinuation of all study
drugs, patients should be strongly encouraged to complete all scheduled
assessments through the end of their current 21-day treatment cycle,
complete blood count (CBC) assessment on
Day 22; all Post-Treatment Visits; and the Survival Follow-up Phase of
the study, which is to continue until at least 70% of the patients on the
study have died. The G1T28-05 study will be completed when the
Survival Follow-up Phase has been completed, or upon sponsor
termination of the study.
Tumor Assessment
Tumor assessments using radiologic imaging will be performed after
every even cycle for the first 9 months of the study (ie, approximately
every 6 weeks) and after every third cycle (ie, approximately every
9 weeks) thereafter while receiving study drug. Tumor assessments will
include tumor response based on RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST. For tumor
assessment, all sites of disease should be assessed radiologically by
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
G1 Therapeutics, Inc.

screening and every scheduled tumor assessment until the occurrence of
disease progression. CT or MRI scans obtained as standard of care prior to
informed consent will not need to be repeated if performed within 14 days
prior to dosing. Brain scans performed as standard of care prior to
informed consent will not need to be repeated if performed within 28 days
prior to dosing. Assessments should be performed within 7 days prior to
starting the subsequent cycle. Additional scans may be obtained at the
discretion of the investigator, if clinically indicated. If a patient shows a
radiological response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]), a
confirmatory radiological assessment will be performed at least 4 weeks
after the response was first noted. For patients who have a confirmed CR,
it is strongly recommended that they receive prophylactic cranial
irradiation (PCI) after completion of chemotherapy (ie, induction).
Patients with a confirmed PR should also consider PCI after completion
of chemotherapy (ie, induction) based on the investigator’s judgment.
Following the completion of the induction part, PCI may be administered
concurrently with atezolizumab during the maintenance part. For those
patients who have not progressed at the time of study drug
discontinuation, tumor assessments to include all sites of disease will be
assessed radiologically by CT or MRI, as performed at screening, every
2 months (approximately 60 ± 7 days) until the occurrence of progressive
disease or study completion. The same method of assessment (CT or
MRI) should be used to characterize tumors at screening and at all
follow-up assessments. If positron emission tomography (PET) is used, it
should also be accompanied by spiral CT or MRI.
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs (including SAEs,
irAEs, and AEs of special interest [AESI]), vital signs measurements,
physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), performance status,
clinical laboratory studies, and IRRs. Safety surveillance reporting of AEs
commences at the time of informed consent. AEs will be collected
through 30 days after the last dose of study drug; SAEs and AESI will be
collected through 90 days after the last dose of study drug.
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor
accumulating safety and disposition data after approximately 12 patients
have been enrolled and have completed at least 1 cycle to assess the initial
safety data from the 2 groups, and then approximately every 4 months
during the Treatment Phase of the study, depending upon the enrollment
rate. Details of the DMC, including objectives, composition, scope, and
frequency, will be described in a DMC charter.
Treatment Duration
Study drug administration will continue for each patient until disease
progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of
consent, or discontinuation by investigator, whichever occurs first.
However, if the patient appears to be deriving clinical benefit, the
investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient, and the patient
has provided re-consent, study drug administration may be continued until
loss of clinical benefit.
Study drug refers to trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A during the induction
part and atezolizumab during the maintenance part.

Statistical Analysis
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized patients and
will be the primary analysis set for efficacy and
.
ITT analyses will be conducted on the basis of the assigned treatment. The
safety analysis set includes all patients who received at least 1 dose of
study drug and will be used for the analysis of safety endpoints. The
safety analysis set analyses will be conducted on the basis of the actual
treatment received. The PK analysis set will include all dosed patients in
the PK portion of the study with evaluable PK data.
Data will be summarized by treatment group. Treatment differences
between treatment groups will be calculated as trilaciclib + E/P/A therapy
versus placebo + E/P/A therapy. The descriptive summary for the
categorical variables will include counts and percentages. The descriptive
summary for the continuous variables will include means, medians,
standard deviations, and minimum and maximum values.
Study G1T28-05 was originally designed as a Phase 2 clinical study to
investigate if myelopreservation, ie, preservation of hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cell (HSPC) and immune system function during
chemotherapy, by trilaciclib could provide survival benefit to patients
receiving a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and an immune
checkpoint inhibitor. Recent results from a clinical study in
treatment-naive extensive-stage SCLC patients (Study G1T28-02) who
received trilaciclib or placebo in combination with etoposide/carboplatin,
provided compelling evidence that trilaciclib resulted in a clinically
meaningful decrease in myelosuppression across 3 lineages: neutrophils,
RBC, and lymphocytes. Hence, the primary analysis in this Study
G1T28-05, where the chemotherapy backbone of etoposide and
carboplatin is the same as Study G1T28-02, is being modified to assess
primary and key secondary myelosuppression efficacy endpoints. This
allows for an earlier assessment of trilaciclib’s mechanism of action
(MOA) and efficacy, with OS retained as a secondary endpoint. This
change in endpoints does not alter the assessments or protocol-defined
patient care.
The primary endpoints include (i) duration of severe (Grade 4)
neutropenia in Cycle 1 and (ii) occurrence of severe (Grade 4)
neutropenia. Occurrence will be displayed as the proportion of patients
with an event for each study arm.
Duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia in Cycle 1 will be analyzed with
nonparametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (Stokes 2012), while
the occurrence of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia will be analyzed using
modified Poisson regression (ie, Poisson regression with a robust error
variance) (Zou 2004),. Unless otherwise specified, these endpoints will be
evaluated for the induction treatment period, which is defined as the
duration between the date of randomization and the end of the last cycle in
the protocol-defined induction phase (ie, last cycle of placebo or trilaciclib
plus E/P/A). There are multiple key secondary endpoints. To
accommodate the primary and key secondary endpoints, a Hochberg-
based gatekeeping procedure will be utilized to control the global
familywise error rate across the multiple null hypotheses in the strong
sense at a 1-sided α=0.025 level.

These analyses will be conducted based on the ITT analysis set. The
stratification factors of ECOG performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) and
presence of brain metastases (yes versus no) will be accounted for in the
statistical analyses. Appropriate sensitivity analyses for the primary and
key secondary endpoints will be conducted to evaluate the robustness of
the results.
Other secondary endpoints including antitumor activity as assessed by
objective response and PFS (as assessed by RECIST version 1.1) and OS
will be evaluated.
Summaries of safety data will be performed using the safety analysis set.
Adverse event data will be coded to system organ class and preferred term
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA;
Version 17.1 or later). The number and percentage of patients
experiencing any treatment-emergent AE, overall, and by system organ
class and preferred term will be tabulated. Absolute values and changes
from baseline in vital signs, ECG results, and hematology and clinical
chemistry parameters will be tabulated at each visit during the Treatment
Phase. Toxicities for clinical labs will be characterized according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03. Shifts in toxicity grades from
baseline will be summarized.
Pharmacokinetic results will be analyzed and reported for the PK analysis
set, separately for each analyte. Plasma concentration-time data will be
tabulated descriptively and graphically by treatment group.
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using noncompartmental
methods based on the plasma concentration-time data. Pharmacokinetic
parameters will be summarized descriptively.
Rationale for Number of
Patients
The sample size calculation is based on demonstrating the superiority of
trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for the primary endpoints. To
maintain the overall type I error rate using the most conservative
Bonferroni procedure for the 2 primary endpoints, a 1-sided
individualized type I error rate 0.025/2 = 0.0125 is assigned to each
outcome variable in the sample size calculation. Assuming a 95%
evaluability rate, at least 106 patients need to be enrolled to complete the
study.

INTRODUCTION
4.1.
Background
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases
worldwide and more than two-thirds of patients present with extensive-stage disease.
Although response rates to first-line chemotherapy in extensive-stage SCLC are in the range
of 50% to 60%, the median duration of response is short (approximately 4 months), with a
median survival of 8 to 10 months and 2-year survival rates of less than 10% (Jemal 2009;
Eckardt 2006; Noda 2002; Hanna 2006; Socinski 2009; Hermes 2008; Schmittel 2006;
Lyman 2006). Increasing evidence suggests that immune responses against SCLC cells make
immunotherapy a viable therapeutic approach in this disease (Horn 2016). Furthermore, there
is evidence that certain chemotherapeutic regimens may augment the immunotherapeutic
response in SCLC, in part by releasing neoantigens and educating the immune system against
the surviving cancer cells.
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®), is a monoclonal antibody that binds to programmed death-ligand
1 (PD-L1), inhibiting its interaction with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
receptor and releasing the PD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response.
Atezolizumab is an immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) (approved in the United States in May 2016) and
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (approved in the United States in
October 2016). Etoposide and carboplatin (E/P) is a standard SCLC treatment and is
currently under investigation with atezolizumab for the treatment of SCLC.
The major drawback to platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens used in SCLC treatment
is dose-limiting myelosuppression, which may antagonize the intended effects of the
immunotherapy by reducing both the number and function of lymphocytes. Therefore, an
approach to maintain immune system function while administering cytotoxic chemotherapy
is needed to fully realize the therapeutic potential of immunotherapies.
Trilaciclib is a highly potent, selective, and reversible cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6)
inhibitor in development to preserve bone marrow and immune system function (including
lymphoid progenitors and lymphocytes) from damage by chemotherapy, allowing faster
hematopoietic recovery, preserving long-term bone marrow function, and enhancing the
antitumor activity of chemotherapy. Trilaciclib is administered intravenously prior to every
dose of chemotherapy in every cycle, eg, on Days 1 to 3 prior to E/P administration in 21-day
cycles, for extensive-stage SCLC. This pulsatile dosing around chemotherapy administration
allows preservation of the bone marrow and immune system without adding to the
chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression caused by chronic inhibition of CDK4/6 in the
bone marrow. Preserving adaptive immunity with trilaciclib may enhance the efficacy of
chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, supporting clinical testing of
the novel combination of etoposide, carboplatin, and atezolizumab (E/P/A) therapy and
trilaciclib.

Study Rationale
Nonclinical studies in mice have shown that trilaciclib causes a “priming” effect on bone
marrow and immune cells. Specifically, trilaciclib administration causes a transient gap 1
(G1) cell cycle arrest in bone marrow progenitors and lymphocytes (B cells and thymocytes),
thus protecting them from cytotoxic chemotherapy damage. The transient G1 cell cycle arrest
is followed by a brief increased rate of proliferation up to 72 hours following trilaciclib
administration before returning to a baseline proliferative rate within 1 week, as
demonstrated by assessing 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation in specific cell
populations. In addition, trilaciclib can protect T lymphocyte numbers and functionality post
chemotherapy treatment. In a well-established 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment murine model,
T lymphocyte populations recovered faster in mice that received up to 4 cycles of
trilaciclib + 5-FU, compared to 5-FU alone. Splenocytes derived from mice that received
trilaciclib + 5-FU and stimulated ex vivo with anti-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) and
anti-CD28 antibodies demonstrated normal levels of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and
interleukin 2 (IL-2) release, while stimulated splenocytes from mice treated with 5-FU alone
demonstrated a decreased release of both cytokines. Taken together, these data suggest that
trilaciclib-mediated preservation of lymphocyte numbers and function, along with the
transient increase in proliferation of lymphocytes and other immune cells coinciding with
chemotherapy-associated neoantigen release, could allow for maximal priming of the
immune system to generate an efficacious adaptive immune response.
Chemotherapy-induced lymphopenia is a well-known phenomenon, yet has not been well
studied in the past. Chemotherapy-associated late bone marrow toxicity results from
therapy-induced damage and premature exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
Cytotoxics can cause direct damage to activated HSCs, but also induce functional attrition of
HSCs indirectly through a process of proliferative exhaustion. This HSC intrinsic damage
leads to a reduction of long-term multilineage reconstitution potential as well as
myeloid-biased differentiation, resulting in lymphopenia. Nonclinical data demonstrate that
trilaciclib administered prior to chemotherapy for multiple cycles can lead to a lasting
protection of HSC function, thereby ameliorating the long-term toxicity associated with serial
exposure to chemotherapy agents (ie, “exhaustion”), and preservation from myeloid-biased
differentiation.
Chemotherapy-induced lymphopenia could potentially decrease the efficacy of immune
checkpoint inhibitors when administered with chemotherapy. As a clinical biomarker of
immune system function, baseline lymphocyte counts from patients with SCLC who received
first-line E/P (N = 134) or second-line topotecan therapy (N = 78) were evaluated via a
retrospective chart review and in data from 2 ongoing SCLC clinical trials testing the
combination of trilaciclib with these chemotherapy regimens (first line, E/P, NCT02499770;
and second line, topotecan, NCT02514447). Baseline lymphocyte counts from patients with
SCLC were lower at the start of second-line treatment compared to the start of first-line
treatment (1116 versus 1481/μL, respectively; p = 0.0002), demonstrating persistent
lymphopenia months after first-line chemotherapy. In the ongoing trilaciclib SCLC studies,
lymphocyte counts have remained relatively unchanged through repeated cycles of both first-
and second-line chemotherapy, demonstrating preservation of this important cell population.

Currently, there are no approved treatments to decrease myelosuppression across multiple
lineages by preserving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function. Although
some therapies may help to address issues once they have occurred (eg, transfusions, growth
factors, etc), there are no available options that provide patients with a means to effectively
preserve HSPC and immune system function from chemotherapy-induced damage and the
resultant negative impact. For this reason, patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy
often experience clinically significant consequences, such as severe neutropenia and risk of
infections, anemia requiring red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, dose reductions, etc. Thus,
myelosuppression continues to be a serious side effect of chemotherapy for patients with
SCLC who have significant side effects from treatment, short time to progression, and poor
overall survival (OS). This population would benefit from a therapeutic option that
minimizes the myelosuppressive impact of treatment by reducing the frequency of severe
cytopenias, preserving immune system function, and maintaining long-term bone marrow
function. Minimizing myelosuppression should, ideally, lead to decreased
chemotherapy-induced morbidity and mortality, facilitation of optimal standard of care
chemotherapy regimens, and enhanced antitumor activity.
To evaluate the effect of trilaciclib in combination with chemotherapy and an immune
checkpoint inhibitor, immunocompetent MC38 tumor-bearing mice were treated with
trilaciclib, oxaliplatin, or anti-PD-L1 alone or in combination, and tumor size was measured
during and post treatment for 100 days. The addition of trilaciclib to an oxaliplatin/anti-PD-
L1 combination (TOP) treatment significantly improved the overall response rate, complete
response rate, and median OS compared to oxaliplatin/anti-PD-L1 combination (93% vs
46%; 79% vs 38%; not reached at 100 days vs 59 days, respectively). Taken together, this
demonstrates that trilaciclib, which has been shown to preserve immune function during
chemotherapy, enhances the antitumor activity of chemotherapy/anti-PD-L1 combination
therapy.
In summary, nonclinical data demonstrate that trilaciclib administration with chemotherapy
preserves bone marrow and immune system function from damage by chemotherapy.
Additionally, clinical data from Study G1T28-02 (Section 4.3.1), where patients received
trilaciclib or placebo in combination with etoposide/carboplatin, provides compelling
evidence that trilaciclib decreases myelosuppression across 3 lineages (neutrophils, RBC, and
lymphocytes), and suggests that trilaciclib contributes to a more functional activated immune
system as compared with placebo. It is this difference that is hypothesized to translate into
potentially improved efficacy (eg, OS) when chemotherapy is combined with checkpoint
inhibitors.

Summary of Clinical Data
4.3.1.
Trilaciclib
A brief summary of the clinical data with trilaciclib is provided in the following sections.
Detailed information is presented in the trilaciclib Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
Study G1T28-1-01 was a Phase 1a, safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic study of trilaciclib.
Forty-five healthy male and female subjects were enrolled into 7 dose cohorts where
trilaciclib was administered intravenous (IV) as a 30-minute infusion (randomized,

double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending doses of 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, or 192 mg/m2, and an
open-label expanded pharmacodynamic cohort at 192 mg/m2).
The most frequently (> 10% of subjects) reported adverse events (AEs) were the following:
headache (17 subjects, 38%), nausea (10 subjects, 22%), pain in extremity (8 subjects, 18%),
and procedural pain (7 subjects, 16%). The treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) of headache
and nausea occurred more frequently in the combined 192 mg/m2 dose group (14 events of
headache reported by 13 subjects [72%] and 10 events of nausea reported by 9 subjects
[50%]) than in the lower dose groups. Most TEAEs were mild in intensity; 13 subjects
experienced a total of 19 TEAEs of moderate intensity. Four AEs of moderate intensity
occurred in the 96 mg/m2 dose group (2 events of headache [possibly related], 1 event of
back pain [unlikely related], and 1 event of nausea [possibly related]). Fifteen AEs of
moderate intensity occurred in the combined 192 mg/m2 dose group (7 events of headache
[all possibly related], 6 events of nausea [all possibly related], 1 event of procedural anxiety
[not related], and 1 event of loss of appetite [possibly related]). No severe or life-threatening
events were reported. There were no deaths, other serious adverse events (SAEs), or TEAEs
resulting in withdrawal from the study. All TEAEs were transient and recovered/resolved by
the end of the study. No significant changes were noted in 12-lead electrocardiograms
(ECGs), vital signs, or laboratory values (including complete blood counts [CBCs]).
Following a single 30-minute IV infusion of trilaciclib, the median time to reach the
maximum concentration (Tmax) ranged between 0.25 and 0.47 hour after the start of infusion.
The maximum concentration (Cmax) increased in a dose-proportional manner following a
single 30-minute IV infusion of trilaciclib over the dose range of 6 to 192 mg/m2. Total
systemic (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) exposure increased more than
dose proportionally over the dose range of 6 to 192 mg/m2 of trilaciclib. The elimination
kinetics of trilaciclib appeared to follow a 3-compartment model. The geometric mean
half-life (t1/2) was 12.9 to 14.7 hours for the 48 to 192 mg/m2 dose levels. The interpatient
variability (%CV) of the PK parameters at the 192 mg/m2 dose level was low (< 15%). The
PK of trilaciclib suggests that drug accumulation following repeated administration is
unlikely to occur. Urinary excretion appears to be a minor route of elimination for unchanged
trilaciclib.
Trilaciclib showed positive pharmacodynamic effects in 2 assays. Dose-dependent inhibition
of ex vivo whole blood stimulation occurred following a single IV infusion of trilaciclib at 96
and 192 mg/m2 (maximum mean inhibition of 37.2% and 60%, respectively, occurred
4 hours after the end of infusion). Lymphocyte proliferation started to recover 8 hours after
the end of infusion, but inhibition of proliferation persisted until the last sampling time point
of 24 hours. Assessment of bone marrow 24 hours after administration of trilaciclib at the
biologically effective dose (BED) of 192 mg/m2 revealed a significant decrease in the
number of HSPCs in the synthesis (S)/gap 2 (G2)/mitosis (M) phases of the cell cycle (ie, an
increase in the proportion of cells in G1 arrest). This G1 arrest persisted in the different
progenitor lineages 32 hours after dosing. However, no changes were noted in the peripheral
blood counts, indicating that the bone marrow arrest is transient and reversible and is
consistent with the effects seen in animals.
Trilaciclib is also being tested in 2 ongoing Phase 1b/2a studies (G1T28-02 and G1T28-03).
Study G1T28-02 is designed to assess the safety and PK of trilaciclib in combination with

E/P therapy for patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage SCLC. Study G1T28-03 is
designed to assess the safety and PK of trilaciclib in combination with topotecan for patients
with previously treated extensive-stage SCLC. The safety profiles observed to date in
G1T28-02 and G1T28-03 are consistent with the general safety profile of patients undergoing
chemotherapy treatment; no new safety signals have been identified as of the trilaciclib IB
data cutoff date of 20 May 2016.
In G1T28-02, a total of 19 patients were treated in the dose exploration Part 1, and
75 patients were treated in the placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized Part 2.
(Please see the current version of the trilaciclib IB for detailed information on Part 1
patients.) The unblinded randomized results from Part 2 provide proof-of-concept evidence
of the myelopreservation benefits of trilaciclib combined with E/P compared with placebo +
E/P. The trilaciclib arm was favored across all neutrophil-related endpoints, including the
proportion of patients with Grade 4 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) values (16/37 [43.2%]
for placebo versus 2/38 [5.3%] for trilaciclib: p-value = 0.0001) and dose reductions due to
neutropenia (10/37 [32.4%] for placebo versus 2/38 [5.3%] for trilaciclib: p-value = 0.0033).
In alignment with the reduction of Grade 4 ANC events, the proportion of patients who
received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was also significantly lower in the
trilaciclib group (4/38 [10.5%]) than in the placebo group (24/37 [64.9%]: p-value < 0.0001).
RBC endpoints also favored trilaciclib versus placebo, eg, 2/35 (5.7%) of patients enrolled on
the trilaciclib arm received an RBC transfusion on/after Week 5 versus 8/37 (21.6%) of
patients in the placebo arm. In addition, mean lymphocyte counts over time in the trilaciclib
arm were greater than those observed in the placebo arm, and the recovery to baseline after
each chemotherapy-induced lymphocyte nadir was faster in the trilaciclib arm compared with
the placebo arm. Consistent with the faster recovery of lymphocyte counts, E/P + trilaciclib,
as compared to E/P + placebo, not only increased the total number of circulating CD8+ cells
during treatment, but also resulted in a larger population of activated CD8+ T cells, and
fewer regulatory T cells; both of which are consistent with a more robust immune response
which could correlate with improved antitumor responses. In Part 2, almost all patients
reported at least 1 TEAE, and almost all patients reported TEAEs related to etoposide or
carboplatin. Approximately half the patients reported TEAEs related to trilaciclib, but none
were ≥Grade 3, which suggests that trilaciclib is not associated with severe toxicity. There
were notably fewer high-grade (≥Grade 3 and ≥Grade 4) TEAEs reported during treatment
with trilaciclib compared with placebo, an observation primarily driven by a significant
decrease in the number of hematologic high-grade TEAEs reported in the trilaciclib arm.
Fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were the most frequent TEAEs in the
trilaciclib group. Neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia were the most
frequent TEAEs in the placebo group.
In G1T28-03, the majority of patients (92.9%; 13 of 14) reported TEAEs, with the most
common (ie, reported by > 50% of patients) being thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia,
and leukopenia. TEAEs considered related to trilaciclib per investigator assessment were
reported by 4 patients (28.6%). The majority of patients (85.7%) reported at least 1 Grade 3,
4, or 5 TEAE; those reported by more than 1 patient included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
neutropenia, anemia, neutrophil count decreased, pneumonia, and dyspnea. The majority of
the Grade 3, 4, or 5 TEAEs have been reported by patients in Cohorts 1 and 2, likely due to
the supratherapeutic levels of topotecan observed in these patients, which may be responsible
for the higher number of hematology-related TEAEs in Cohorts 1 and 2. Over one-half of

patients (64.3%) reported an SAE, all of which were considered unlikely or not related to
trilaciclib and did not meet DLT criteria. One patient died during participation in the study
due to an SAE of disease progression that was considered unrelated to trilaciclib by the
investigator.
The PK assessments of trilaciclib in the ongoing studies support the findings from the study
in healthy male and female subjects (GT128-01). Clearance was observed to be high, with
little or no drug accumulation during 3 or 4 days of dosing, except at the trilaciclib
280 mg/m2 dose level tested in Study G1T28-03.

Atezolizumab
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) has been evaluated in several clinical indications. At this time,
atezolizumab is approved for patients with UC and NSCLC, for which safety data is
available and briefly summarized below. Further details are provided in the Atezolizumab
Guidance for the Investigator (Appendix 1) and atezolizumab prescribing information
(Appendix 2).
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (rate ≥20%) in patients with UC included fatigue
(52%), decreased appetite (26%), nausea (25%), urinary tract infection (22%), pyrexia
(21%), and constipation (21%).
The most common adverse reactions (rate ≥20%) in patients with NSCLC included fatigue
(46%), decreased appetite (35%), dyspnea (32%), cough (30%), nausea (22%),
musculoskeletal pain (22%), and constipation (20%).
Serious Adverse Reactions
Based on pooled data from atezolizumab single-agent studies in patients with UC, NSCLC,
and other indications (N = 1978), with additional safety data as of 10 May 2016 across
patients who have received atezolizumab single agent or in combination with
chemotherapy/targeted therapy (N = 6053) (where applicable), the serious adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) occurring in > 1% of patients included the following: dyspnea (3.0%, 60 of
1978 patients), pyrexia (2.4%, 48 of 1978 patients), back pain (1.2%, 23 of 1978 patients),
pneumonitis (fatal outcome expected for reporting purposes) (1.2%, 24 of 6053 patients), and
abdominal pain (1.1%, 22 of 1978 patients).
Potential risks and adverse events of special interest (AESI) identified for atezolizumab are

4.4.1.
Pharmacology Studies
Trilaciclib
Through a structure-based design approach to optimize potency, selectivity, and drug
metabolism and PK properties, G1 Therapeutics, Inc. identified trilaciclib as a highly potent
inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] values of 0.8 and
6 nM, respectively) that is highly selective for CDK4 versus cyclin-dependent kinase
2 (CDK2) (> 2000-fold selectivity).
The trilaciclib-induced G1 arrest of HSPCs has been shown to be transient and readily
reversible in both in vitro and in vivo models. In vivo analysis has demonstrated that
coadministration of trilaciclib with myelosuppressive chemotherapy leads to improved CBC
recovery of all blood lineages and increased survival. In addition, administration of trilaciclib
with every cycle of the highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy 5-FU for a total of 4 cycles
demonstrated that the reduction in chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression persisted
following Cycle 4. While the extent and duration of nadir in CBCs worsened after each cycle
of 5-FU administered alone, coadministration of trilaciclib with 5-FU ameliorated this
worsening effect and the animals that received trilaciclib + 5-FU demonstrated a faster rate of
recovery of CBCs compared with the 5-FU alone group following Cycle 4. In accordance
with the single-dose study, trilaciclib administration with all cycles of 5-FU maintained the
protective effect against 5-FU-induced DNA damage in HSPCs over multiple cycles, leading
to an effect that persisted and was greater following multiple cycles of trilaciclib + 5-FU
compared with 5-FU alone. In addition, bone marrow obtained from mice that received
4 cycles of trilaciclib administered prior to every dose of 5-FU was more robust at
hematopoietic reconstitution of lethally irradiated mice following bone marrow
transplantation compared with bone marrow obtained from mice that received 4 cycles of
5-FU alone, suggesting that trilaciclib administered with chemotherapy can preserve stem
cell function.
Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the direct downstream target of CDK4/6 and its expression is
required for CDK4/6-dependent cells. Importantly, cancers that delete Rb do not require
CDK4/6 activity for cell cycle progression (Fry 2004); therefore, loss of Rb is a hallmark
identifier of CDK4/6 independence. Since inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene (RB-1) is
an obligate event in SCLC development (D’Amico 1992; Heighway 2004; Yuan 1999;
Cagle 1997; Gouyer 1994, Peifer 2012; Rudin 2012), this tumor type is highly resistant to
CDK4/6 inhibitors and coadministration of CDK4/6 inhibitors with DNA damaging
chemotherapeutic agents such as those used in SCLC are not expected to antagonize the
efficacy of such agents. In vitro analysis has shown that RB-1 inactive cells are resistant to
CDK4/6 inhibition and therefore are not protected from chemotherapy when cotreated with
trilaciclib. To expand these findings in vivo, trilaciclib was tested alone and in combination
with topotecan or an E/P combination regimen in a cell-based xenograft SCLC model (H69)
in immune-deficient mice. Trilaciclib administered alone or 30 minutes before E/P or
topotecan was well tolerated, with no additive weight loss or toxicity. Single agent trilaciclib
was inactive towards NCI-H69 SCLC tumors and combination with an E/P regimen did not

result in additive efficacy, nor did it antagonize the intended effects of E/P. Combination of
trilaciclib and topotecan was superior to topotecan alone during dosing and the addition of
trilaciclib extended the statistically significant (p < 0.05) antitumor effect of topotecan after
dosing. Thus, trilaciclib was well tolerated and did not antagonize the effects of
chemotherapy in a CDK4/6-independent (RB-1 inactive) SCLC tumor model.

A summary of the pharmacology studies of atezolizumab is provided in the prescribing
information (Appendix 2).
4.4.2.
Pharmacokinetic Studies
Trilaciclib
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in rats and dogs showed that the relationship between dose
level and plasma exposure to trilaciclib was generally similar between males and females and
did not change with repeated daily dosing. Exposure to trilaciclib increased with dose level,
but not always proportionally. Plasma half-life values for trilaciclib after IV administration
were approximately 4 hours in rats and dogs.
In vitro analyses of direct and time-dependent inhibition suggest that drug interactions based
on inhibition of cytochrome P40 (CYP)1A2-, 2B6-, 2C8-, 2C9-, 2C19-, and 2D6-mediated
metabolic pathways are unlikely at concentrations of trilaciclib below 100 µM
(44,600 ng/ml). Drug interactions based on trilaciclib mechanism-based inhibition of
CYP3A4-mediated metabolic pathways are possible. Additionally, in vitro induction studies
of the 3 major inducible CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6) in human
hepatocytes suggest that trilaciclib -mediated induction is unlikely.
While etoposide is a CYP3A4 substrate, there are no specific label warnings regarding
coadministration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. This may in part be due to the relatively equal
contributions of renal and hepatic clearance to the total clearance of etoposide. In addition,
administration of oral ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 and uridine disphosphate
glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) inhibitor, with oral etoposide
for 3 of every 5-week cycles resulted in an increase of the median AUC of oral etoposide of
only 20% and did not alter its toxicity profile (Yong 2007). In the present Study G1T28-05,
IV trilaciclib will be administered prior to IV etoposide on Days 1 to 3 of 21-day cycles in
patients with adequate renal function. In the Phase 1b dose-finding portion of Part 1 of the
G1T28-02 study in patients with newly diagnosed SCLC, where the same doses of etoposide
of carboplatin were used as in this study, PK of etoposide, carboplatin, and trilaciclib were
assessed on Days 1 and 3 of the first cycle. The PK of etoposide and carboplatin was
consistent with historical data, indicating the lack of a drug-drug interaction between
trilaciclib and etoposide or carboplatin.
In vitro inhibition studies with membrane transporter model systems also suggest trilaciclib is
unlikely to cause a drug-drug interaction (DDI) based on inhibition of breast cancer
resistance protein (BCRP)-, bile salt export pump (BSEP)-, organic anion transporter
1 (OAT1)-, organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3)-, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1

(OATP1B1)-, p-glycoprotein (MDR1)-, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1)-, multidrug
resistance protein 2 (MRP2)-, organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1)-, or organic anion
transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3)-mediated transport. Trilaciclib is a potent inhibitor
of multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1), multidrug and toxin extrusion 2-K
(MATE2-K), and organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) (IC50 values were 0.175, 0.071, and
0.152 µM, respectively), and therefore, may be a cause of a DDI if coadministered with
substrates of these transporters.
Carboplatin has been reported (Yonezawa 2006) to not be a substrate for OCT2, MATE1, or
MATE2. Etoposide has not been reported to be a substrate for any of these 3 transporters,
and by structure is not expected to be a substrate. Based upon these data, a clinically
significant alteration of carboplatin or etoposide PK due to trilaciclib inhibition of OCT2,
MATE1, or MATE2-K is not expected, and none was detected in the G1T28-02 study in
patients with newly diagnosed SCLC.

Trilaciclib
When administered IV daily for 7 days, trilaciclib was tolerated in rats at up to 50 mg/kg
(approximately 300 mg/m2) and in dogs at up to 15 mg/kg (approximately 300 mg/m2), with
toxicity characterized chiefly by reduced hematopoiesis that involved all cell lineages and
was a reflection of the drug’s intended pharmacodynamic activity. The magnitude and/or
duration of effect differed among cell lineages, but were dose related in all lineages. Effects
on hematopoiesis were readily monitored by peripheral blood cell counts and were reversible
when dosing stopped. Clinically significant leukopenia occurred in rats and dogs given IV

trilaciclib for 7 days at ≥150 and 300 mg/m2, respectively, and it led to morbidity and
mortality in dogs given daily doses for 6 days at 900 mg/m2.
In addition to the intended effects on hematopoiesis, animal studies with trilaciclib suggest
that potential side effects in human patients might include the following:

Pulmonary macrophage accumulation: In rats, daily oral doses of trilaciclib for 14 days at
≥5 mg/kg (≥30 mg/m2) resulted in minimal to mild accumulation of foamy macrophages
in alveoli. The magnitude of this finding increased with dose level, but it was not
associated with any discernable change in the rate or character of respiration.
Macrophage accumulation showed evidence of resolving within 3 weeks after dosing
stopped. Pulmonary macrophage accumulation was also seen in dogs given daily IV
doses of trilaciclib by 30-minute infusion at 45 mg/kg (900 mg/m2) for 5 days, at which
point dosing was stopped due to toxicity. The DLT in these dogs was considered to be
severe immunocompromise secondary to inhibition of myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis;
ie, an extension of the primary pharmacodynamic activity of trilaciclib.
•
Increased heart rate: In dogs, single IV doses of trilaciclib at ≥15 mg/kg (≥300 mg/m2)
produced increases in heart rate that were relatively mild (30 to 60 beats per minute
[bpm]) and resolved within a few hours.
•
Effects on liver: Daily IV doses of trilaciclib in rats at ≥10 mg/kg/day (≥60 mg/m2/day)
and in dogs at ≥15 mg/kg/day (approximately 300 mg/m2/day) resulted in slightly
increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
levels. Liver-related effects in both species were reversible within 2 weeks after the last
dose. There were no effects on liver in rats given daily oral doses for 14 days at up to
30 mg/kg (180 mg/m2).
•
Local irritation at the infusion site: Dogs given daily doses of trilaciclib for 7 days had
occasional episodes of swelling/edema at the infusion site. This was considered likely to
be due to leakage or accidental injection of dosing solution into the perivenous tissue.
The profile of TEAEs reported in the trilaciclib clinical development program are consistent
with the underlying patient population with SCLC undergoing chemotherapy. There are no
consistent patterns of TEAEs that can be considered attributable to trilaciclib. In addition,
there have been no new risks identified and the preclinical risks have not been linked to
clinical observations.

Important Identified Risks for Atezolizumab
Identified Risk
Description of Risk
Immune-related pneumonitis
Pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (68/2160) of patients who received
atezolizumab. The majority of patients experienced only mild to
moderate events. Of the 68 patients, 64% (36/56) of the All
NSCLC group and 75% (9/12) of the All UC group experienced
events with a maximum severity of Grade 1 or 2. One event was
fatal in the All NSCLC group (considered unrelated to
atezolizumab), and no events were fatal in the All UC group. The
median time to onset was 3.5 months (range: 3 days to
20.5 months). The median duration was 1.5 months (range: 0 days
to 15.1 + months; + denotes a censored value). Pneumonitis led to
discontinuation of atezolizumab in 10 (0.5%) patients.
Pneumonitis requiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in 1.6%
(34/2160) of patients receiving atezolizumab. As expected,
pneumonitis events occurred more frequently in the NSCLC
patient population, most likely due to higher baseline incidence,
higher prevalence of other risk factors, and atezolizumab-induced
immunologic response to the tumor.
Immune-related hepatitis
Cases of hepatitis, some leading to fatal outcomes, have been
observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab. Most of the hepatic
events identified were non-serious elevations of liver enzymes.
Hepatitis occurred in 0.3% (7/2160) of patients who received
atezolizumab. The median time to onset was 1.1 months (range:
9 days to 7.9 months). The median duration was 1 month (range: 9
days to 1.9+ months; + denotes a censored value). Hepatitis led to
discontinuation of atezolizumab in 2 (< 0.1%) patients. Hepatitis
requiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in 0.2% (5/2160) of
patients receiving atezolizumab. All of these events resolved with
the exception of 1 case of Grade 1 hepatitis, which was resolving
at the time of data cutoff. Additionally, 1 patient (< 0.1%)
experienced hepatic failure (with fatal outcome, considered
unrelated to study therapy).
Immune-related colitis
Cases of diarrhea or colitis have been observed in clinical trials
with atezolizumab. Colitis occurred in 1.1% (23/2160) of patients
who received atezolizumab. The median time to onset was
4 months (range: 15 days to 15.2 months). The median duration
was 1.4 months (range: 3 days to 17.8+ months; + denotes a
censored value). Colitis led to the discontinuation of atezolizumab
in 5 (0.2%) patients. Colitis requiring the use of corticosteroids
occurred in 0.5% (10/2160) of patients receiving atezolizumab.
Immune-related pancreatitis
Pancreatitis and elevations in serum amylase and lipase occurred
in 0.5% (10/2160) of patients who received atezolizumab. Most
events identified were non-serious elevations in lipase or amylase.
A total of 4 (0.2%) patients experienced pancreatitis, including
1 patient with acute pancreatitis. The median time to onset was
5.5 months (range: 9 days to 16.9 months). The median duration
was 19 days (range: 3 days to 11.2+ months; + denotes a censored
value). Pancreatitis requiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in
< 0.1% (2/2160) of patients receiving atezolizumab.

Description of Risk
Immune-related diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.3% (7/2160) of patients who
received atezolizumab (4 reports of diabetes mellitus, 2 reports of
type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1 report of type 2 diabetes mellitus).
Of these 7 patients, 2 developed serious events and 5 developed
events that were considered non-serious. Two cases resolved,
1 case resolved with sequelae, and 4 were not resolved by the time
of the clinical cutoff. The time to onset ranged from 3 days to 6.5
months. Diabetes mellitus led to the discontinuation of
atezolizumab in 1 (< 0.1%) patient.
Immune-related hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism occurred in 4.7% (101/2160) of patients who
received atezolizumab. The median time to onset was 5.5 months
(range: 15 days to 31.3 months). Events have generally been mild,
and patients who received treatment with thyroid replacement
were able to continue on study treatment. A total of 19 patients
experienced adverse events that appear in both the hypothyroidism
and hyperthyroidism standardised MedDRA queries (SMQs).
These 19 patients are therefore duplicated in the data presented on
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. The vast majority of the
duplicated patients were reported to have experienced blood
thyroid stimulating hormone increased. Because primary
hypothyroidism is more prevalent than hyperthyroidism in patients
treated with both atezolizumab and other drugs in this class, it is
probable that the majority of patients that appear in both searches
actually developed hypothyroidism.
Immune-related hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 1.7% (36/2160) of patients who
received atezolizumab. The median time to onset was 3.5 months
(range: 21 days to 31.3 months). No severe events were identified.
Please see immune-related hypothyroidism above for patients
duplicated in the data presented on hypothyroidism and
hyperthyroidism.
Immune-related adrenal insufficiency
Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.3% (7/2160) of patients who
received atezolizumab. The median time to onset was 5.7 months
(range: 3 days to 19 months). Adrenal insufficiency requiring the
use of corticosteroids occurred in 0.3% (6/2160) of patients
receiving atezolizumab.
Immune-related hypophysitis
Hypophysitis occurred in < 0.1% (1/2160) of patients who
received atezolizumab. The time to onset for this patient was
13.7 months.
Immune-related Guillain-Barré
syndrome
Guillain-Barré syndrome and demyelinating polyneuropathy
occurred in 0.2% (5/2160) of patients who received atezolizumab.
The median time to onset was 7 months (range: 18 days to
8.1 months). The median duration was 4.6 months (0+ day to 8.3+
months). Guillain-Barré syndrome led to discontinuation of
atezolizumab in 1 patient (< 0.1%). Guillain-Barré syndrome
requiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in < 0.1% (2/2160) of
patients receiving atezolizumab
Immune-related myasthenic
syndrome/myasthenia gravis
Myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, which may be life
threatening, were observed in patients receiving atezolizumab.
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of motor and sensory
neuropathy. Four cases of myasthenia gravis or myasthenic

syndrome have been reported from across the entire development
program as of 07 July 2016. The first case concerned a 64-year-
old male patient receiving atezolizumab monotherapy for renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) in the Study PCD4989g (GO27831). The
patient was positive for acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies
and acetylcholine receptor modulating antibodies. The event was
considered serious, and the patient was treated with corticosteroids
and discontinued from the study. A second case of myasthenia
gravis was received concerning a 64-year-old male patient
receiving atezolizumab in combination with ipilimumab in Study
GO29322. The event was considered serious, and the patient was
treated with corticosteroids and mycophenolate and discontinued
from the study. The third case concerned a 56-year-old male who
developed bilateral ptosis while receiving atezolizumab
monotherapy for urothelial bladder cancer in the expanded access
program ML29725. The patient was positive for acetylcholine
receptor antibodies, acetylcholine receptor modulating antibodies
and striated muscles antibodies and was diagnosed with
myasthenia gravis. The event was considered serious and the
patient was treated with corticosteroids and discontinued from
atezolizumab. The fourth case concerned a 67-year-old female
patient receiving atezolizumab in combination with cobimetinib in
Study GP28363. The patient developed ptosis, an acetylcholine
receptor antibody test was negative and the results of the nerve
conduction studies were normal. The patient was diagnosed with
myasthenia gravis and treated with pyridostigmine, and
atezolizumab and cobimetinib were discontinued.
Immune-related meningoencephalitis
Meningitis occurred in 0.1% (3/2160) of patients who received
atezolizumab. The time to onset ranged from 15 to 16 days. All
3 patients required the use of corticosteroids and discontinued
atezolizumab. Encephalitis occurred in < 0.1% (2/2160) of
patients. The time to onset was 14 and 16 days. Encephalitis led to
discontinuation of atezolizumab in 1 (< 0.1%) patient.
Encephalitis requiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in
< 0.1% (1/2160) of patients receiving atezolizumab
Immune-related myocarditis
Although no cases were identified from the pooled 2160 patients
who received single agent atezolizumab, 2 cases of myocarditis,
including a life-threatening case, have been reported from across
the entire development program as of 20 February 2017. The time
to onset ranged from 18 to 33 days. The first case concerned a
59-year-old female patient with follicular lymphoma receiving
atezolizumab in combination with bendamustine and
obinutuzumab in Study BO29563. Her cardiac biopsy revealed
T-cell infiltration. The second case concerned a 69-year-old male
patient with RCC receiving atezolizumab in combination with
bevacizumab in Study WO29637. He developed clinical
sign/symptoms including chest pressure, and positive diagnostic
test results including abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) and
increased cardiac enzymes. Both patients discontinued
atezolizumab and required the use of corticosteroids

Description of Risk
Immune-related nephritis
Immune-related nephritis is a relatively rare complication of
checkpoint inhibitor therapy with the most common reported
underlying pathology being acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis
(ATIN). The most common presentation is an asymptomatic
increase in creatinine levels. In the absence of alternative
etiologies (eg, prerenal and postrenal causes, and concomitant
medications), immune-related nephritis is defined as renal
dysfunction requiring steroids treatment and/or confirmed by
biopsy
Infusion-related reactions
Infusion-related reactions are known to occur with the
administration of monoclonal antibodies. The signs and symptoms
of infusion-related reactions share considerable overlap with
several very common atezolizumab adverse drug reactions
(ADRs) including influenza-like illness, pyrexia, and rash. The
identified reactions occurred within 24 hours of atezolizumab
administration and were generally mild to moderate in severity,
and only 10 patients (0.5%) out of the 2160 pooled UC and
NSCLC patients developed SAEs. Twenty-four (1.1%) of
2160 patients were reported to have experienced the event of
infusion reaction (with 2 serious events). Across all 2160 patients,
16 patients (0.7%) were reported to have hypersensitivity (with
4 serious events), and none were reported to have experienced
anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions.
Notes: The cutoff dates for the following studies are 31 March 2016 for Study PCD4989g, 07 January 2015 for FIR,
01 December 2015 for POPLAR, 01 December 2015 for BIRCH, 07 July 2016 for OAK, and 04 July 2016 for

Potential Risks for Atezolizumab
Potential Risk
Description of Risk
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA)
Cynomolgus Monkey Studies: After a single intravenous (IV)
administration of atezolizumab to cynomolgus monkeys, antidrug
antibodies (ADAs) were detected in 12 of 12 animals (100%) at
Day 14; 11 of 12 animals remained ADA positive after Day 14
until the end of the study. Fifty of 56 animals (89%) given
atezolizumab tested positive for ADA following 9 weekly doses.
While ADAs affected the pharmacokinetics of some animals,
average exposure for ADA -positive and ADA-negative animals
was similar.
Clinical Studies: ADAs have been observed in the clinical trials
to date for atezolizumab; however, at doses of 10 mg/kg and
above, they do not appear to affect exposure. The incidence of
serious adverse events (SAEs) was increased in ADA-positive
patients (40.5%) compared with ADA-negative patients (34%),
but no specific trend in either MedDRA system organ class (SOC)
or individual adverse event preferred term (PT) was identified in
ADA-positive patients. In all safety-evaluable patients with
available post-treatment ADA status (n = 2007), the incidence of
hypersensitivity events and infusion-related reactions was low and
numerically higher in ADA- positive than ADA-negative patients.
Hypersensitivity events were reported in 24 patients (1.2%):

9 ADA-negative (0.7%) and 15 ADA- positive (1.9%) patients.
Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25 patients (1.2%):
14 ADA-negative (1.1%) and 11 ADA-positive (1.4%) patients.
The incidences of all grade AEs, Grade 5 AEs, AEs leading to
treatment discontinuation, AEs leading to dose interruption, and
adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were similar
irrespective of post-baseline ADA status (negative or positive).
Numerical differences were observed in Grade 3/4 AEs (40.7% in
ADA-negative vs. 47.0% in ADA-positive patients), but no
individual PT could be identified to explain this difference.
Embryofetal toxicity
Several nonclinical studies have demonstrated that the PD-L1/
PD-1 signaling pathway is critical in establishing and maintaining
maternal/fetal tolerance, which is essential for embryo-fetal
survival during gestation (Guleria et al. 2005; Habicht et al. 2007;
D’Addio et al. 2011). Inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway has
not been reported to result in teratogenic effects, and syngeneic
homozygous knockout fetuses (PD-L1 or PD-1 knockouts)
develop normally and have not shown skeletal or visceral defects.
Administration of atezolizumab is expected to have an adverse
effect on pregnancy via modulation of maternal/fetal tolerance,
and poses a risk to the human fetus, including embryo-lethality via
an increased risk of immune- mediated rejection.
No reproductive or teratogenicity studies in animals have been
conducted with atezolizumab. There are no clinical studies of
atezolizumab in pregnant women. Atezolizumab is not
recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for
the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
Immune-related myositis
Immune-related myositis occurred in 0.2% (4/2160) of metastatic
urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and NSCLC patients who received
single-agent atezolizumab. Patients may experience weakness,
tenderness and aching of the muscles. Four cases containing 7
events were identified, including 3 cases of polymyalgia
rheumatica from studies IMvigor 210, FIR and OAK, and 1 case
of dermatomyositis from BIRCH. Atezolizumab treatment was not
changed for all polymyalgia rheumatica events and was
interrupted for the dermatomyositis events. The dermatomyositis
events had features consistent with cancer associated myositis, and
there was insufficient evidence to support the attribution of a
causal relationship between myositis and atezolizumab. Myositis
is an ADR for other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Myositis
remains a potential risk for atezolizumab and will continue to be
monitored by routine pharmacovigilance
Immune-related ocular inflammatory
toxicity
Ocular inflammatory toxicity events occurred in 0.5% (10/2160)
of mUC and NSCLC patients who received single-agent
atezolizumab. Most of the ocular events identified were
nonserious, with Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Four events were
considered relate to atezolizumab and led to treatment
discontinuation, including 1 serious retinopathy, 1 serious optic
neuritis, 1 nonserious optic neuritis, all from Study OAK, and
1 nonserious episcleritis from Study BIRCH. However, these
cases either had clear alternate explanations, including cataract

surgery prior to event, lung cancer paraneoplastic related
neuropathy, previous brain radiotherapy or had very limited
information reported for assessment. Two cases of uveitis, from
Study FIR and OAK, were both considered not related to study
treatment. Based on the totality of the data to date, the evidence
does not support a definitive causal association between
Atezolizumab and ocular inflammatory toxicity. Based on the
totality of the data to date, the evidence does not support a
definitive causal association between atezolizumab and ocular
inflammatory toxicity.
The etiology of uveitis or optic neuritis may include
autoimmunity, demyelinating disorders, inflammation, infections,
drug or toxic reasons, trauma, or the underlying malignancy (Guly
and Forrester 2010, Kale 2016). Immune-related ocular
inflammatory toxicity is considered an important risk for
atezolizumab, and it will continue to be monitored by routine
pharmacovigilance.
Immune-related severe cutaneous
reactions
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions occurred in 0.6% (13/2160) of
mUC and NSCLC patients who received single-agent
atezolizumab. Most of the cutaneous events identified were
nonserious; however, 1 patient (< 0.1%) experienced a serious
case of bullous dermatitis from Study OAK that resolved
following treatment with corticosteroids. Across the clinical
development program, isolated severe skin toxicities including
lichenoid drug reaction, pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome
(localized to the eye) and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been
reported; however, causality to atezolizumab could not be
confirmed. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been
observed in patients treated with other immune checkpoint
inhibitors and are an important potential risk for atezolizumab. It
will continue to be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance.
Immune-related vasculitis
Nonclinical studies demonstrated dose-dependent evidence of
arteritis/periarteritis in cynomolgus monkeys treated with
atezolizumab. Vasculitis occurred in 0.2% (5/2160) of mUC and
NSCLC patients who received single-agent atezolizumab. One
serious event of Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis was reported
that is also represented in the information for immune-related
nephritis due to the overlap in PTs in the search strategies. Three
cases of polymyalgia rheumatica from studies IMvigor 210, FIR
and OAK were reported and are described in the information for
immune-related myositis, due to similar overlapped terms in the
search strategies. One case of nonserious injection site vasculitis
was reported from Study BIRCH. Currently, no causal relationship
with atezolizumab has been established. Immune-related vasculitis
is considered an important potential risk of atezolizumab and it
will continue to be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance

to ≤1%). An analysis was done of the Roche global safety
database with a cut-off date 05 January 2017, which identified
5 patients with evidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia
reported in atezolizumab-treated patients. All cases had possible
alternate etiologies including concomitant medications, suspected
infection, and concurrent therapy with an additional
immunomodulating agent. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is
considered an important potential risk of atezolizumab and it will
continue to be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance.

immune-related nephritis, immune-related uveitis, immune-related myopathies, and
rhabdomyolysis. A list of AESI identified for atezolizumab is provided in Appendix 3.
Other safety events of interest that are currently being monitored in the atezolizumab clinical
program include the following: immune-related myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis.
Reports of myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis, have been observed across the clinical
development program of atezolizumab. Patients who present with signs or symptoms of
muscular pain should be assessed for inflammatory causes of muscle pain. Management of
these patients should be along institutional guidelines.

Study and Dose Rationale
In a Phase 1a, safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic study of trilaciclib (Study G1T28-1-01),
45 healthy male and female subjects were enrolled into 7 dose cohorts where trilaciclib was
administered IV as a 30-minute infusion (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
ascending doses of 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, or 192 mg/m2, and an open-label expanded
pharmacodynamic cohort at 192 mg/m2). Trilaciclib was well tolerated, with no DLTs or
SAEs reported. Pharmacodynamic analysis 24 hours following administration of trilaciclib
192 mg/m2 demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of bone marrow HSPCs in the
S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle (ie, an increase in the proportion of cells in G1 arrest), which
persisted to 32 hours. Thus, dosing of trilaciclib 200 mg/m2 (rounded up from the BED of
192 mg/m2) was selected as the starting dose for the subsequent Phase 1b/2a SCLC studies
(G1T28-02 [administered prior to etoposide and carboplatin] and G1T28-03 [administered
prior to topotecan]). Based on the Phase 1b results from these 2 studies, trilaciclib 240 mg/m2
was chosen as the recommended Phase 2 dose. In the G1T28-02 study, there was no impact
of trilaciclib on etoposide or carboplatin PK. Based on the PK and safety from the G1T28-02
study, the lack of predicted drug-drug interactions and nonoverlapping toxicities between
atezolizumab and trilaciclib, etoposide, and carboplatin, the evaluation of this 4-drug
combination is reasonable. The goals of the present study are to assess the safety, tolerability,
and efficacy of combining trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 with E/P/A therapy.

4.6.
Risk/Benefit Assessment
Trilaciclib is being developed to reduce chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, which is a
significant issue. Nonclinical data demonstrate that trilaciclib administration with
chemotherapy preserves bone marrow and immune system function from damage by
chemotherapy. In addition, preliminary clinical data suggest that lymphocyte numbers are
relatively unchanged when trilaciclib is used in combination with chemotherapy. Preserving
adaptive immunity with trilaciclib may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy combined with
immune checkpoint inhibitors, supporting clinical testing of the novel combination of E/P/A
therapy and trilaciclib.
Given the paucity of hematologic toxicities associated with atezolizumab (Section 6.1 of the
atezolizumab package insert), the addition of atezolizumab to E/P chemotherapy is not
predicted to influence the underlying myelosuppression profile of E/P. Multiple studies of
chemotherapy administered in combination with checkpoint inhibitors suggest that the
addition of a checkpoint inhibitor to a myelosuppressive chemotherapy backbone, does not
result in any new safety signals and does not result in a clinically relevant exacerbation of the
chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (Ghandi 2018; Langer 2016; Rizvi 2016;
Jotte 2018). Therefore, the potential myelopreservation benefit from the addition of trilaciclib
to E/P can be evaluated in a setting that also includes atezolizumab.
Bone marrow HSPCs require CDK4/6 for proliferation. SCLC tumors are almost universally
CDK4/6 independent by virtue of various genetic mutations in the RB-1 gene that result in
the loss of the Rb protein, which is the downstream target of CDK4/6. Therefore, the risk of
producing a G1 cell cycle arrest of the tumor cells, and thereby protecting the tumor from
chemotherapy, is small. As stated in Section 4.5, the BED of IV trilaciclib is 192 mg/m2 and
a dose of 200 mg/m2 was used as the initial starting dose for administration on Days 1 to 3 of
every 21-day cycle in the G1T28-02 study. However, based on clinical data from G1T28-02
and G1T28-03, the recommended Phase 2 dose of trilaciclib is 240 mg/m2. Therefore,
trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 administered on Days 1 to 3 of every 21-day cycle of E/P/A therapy
will be used in the present study.
In conclusion, the possible benefits of combining trilaciclib at a dose of 240 mg/m2 with
E/P/A therapy to preserve bone marrow and immune system function from damage by
chemotherapy and potentially increase the activity of the E/P/A combination regimen
outweigh the potential risks.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1.
Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 2 study of the
efficacy and safety of E/P/A with trilaciclib or placebo therapy for patients with newly
diagnosed extensive-stage SCLC. Approximately 100 patients will be randomly assigned
(1:1 fashion) to trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 or placebo administered IV on Days 1 to 3 with E/P/A
therapy for up to four 21-day cycles (induction part) (Figure 6-1). Randomization will be
stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 to 1 versus
2) and presence of brain metastases (yes versus no). Following the completion of up to
4 chemotherapy-containing (trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A) cycles, patients will proceed to
the maintenance part of the study and receive atezolizumab every 21 days. Study drug refers
to trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A during the induction part and atezolizumab during the
maintenance part. Treatment in both parts will continue until disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation by investigator. Following
disease progression per RECIST v1.1, if the patient appears to be deriving clinical benefit,
the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient, and the patient has provided
re-consent, study drug administration may be continued until loss of clinical benefit. The
study includes 3 phases: Screening Phase, Treatment Phase (induction part + maintenance
part), and Survival Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase begins on the day of first dose
with study treatment and completes after the last Post Treatment Visit.

Randomization will be stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 to 1 versus 2)
and presence of brain metastases (yes versus no).
b
During the induction part of the study, trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A therapy will continue for up to four 21-day cycles
or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation by the patient or investigator. Tumors should be
assessed after every even cycle (ie, approximately every 6 weeks) using RECIST, Version 1.1. Following disease
progression per RECIST v1.1, if the patient appears to be deriving clinical benefit, the investigator believes it is in the
best interest of the patient, and the patient has provided re-consent, study drug administration may be continued until
loss of clinical benefit (see Section 11.1.4). Assessments should be performed within 7 days of starting the subsequent
cycle.
c
Following induction, patients will proceed to the maintenance part of the study and receive atezolizumab every 21 days
until disease progression per RECIST, Version 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation by the patient or
investigator. Tumors should be assessed after every even cycle for the first 9 months of the study (ie, approximately
every 6 weeks) and after every third cycle (ie, approximately every 9 weeks) thereafter while receiving study drug.
Following disease progression per RECIST v1.1, if the patient appears to be deriving clinical benefit, the investigator
believes it is in the best interest of the patient, and the patient has provided re-consent, study drug administration may
be continued until loss of clinical benefit (see Section 11.1.4).
d
All patients will return to the study center for post-treatment visits at 30 (+ 3) and 90 (+7) days after the last dose of
study drug.
e
The Survival Follow-up Phase will continue until at least 70% of the patients randomized in the study have died.
The initial diagnosis of SCLC should be made based on standard pathological examination,
preferably including immunohistochemical staining for neuroendocrine features. Archived
tumor samples should be available for banking for assessment of relevant DNA, ribonucleic
acid (RNA), and protein markers, such as PD-L1 or those involved in the CDK4/6 pathway.
Tumor samples may be banked for up to 10 years.
6.1.1.
Criteria for Subsequent Cycles and Study Duration
Study drug administration will continue for up to 4 chemotherapy-containing (trilaciclib or
placebo + E/P/A) cycles during the induction part of the study and atezolizumab will be
administered every 21 days during the maintenance part of the study. Study drug
administration will continue until disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or
discontinuation by investigator, whichever occurs first. However, if the patient appears to be
deriving clinical benefit, the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient, and
the patient has provided re-consent, study drug administration may be continued until loss of

The Survival Follow-up Phase will continue until at least 70% of the randomized patients
have died.
6.1.2.
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs (including SAEs, irAEs and AESI), vital
signs measurements, physical examinations, ECGs, performance status, clinical laboratory
studies, and IRRs as described in Section 11.4. Safety surveillance reporting of AEs
commences at the time of informed consent. AEs will be collected through 30 days after the
last dose of study drug; SAEs and AESI will be collected through 90 days after the last dose
of study drug.
6.1.3.
Data Monitoring Committee
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor accumulating safety and
disposition data after approximately 12 patients have been enrolled and have completed at
least 1 cycle to assess the initial safety data from the 2 groups, and then approximately every
4 months during the Treatment Phase of the study, depending upon the enrollment rate.
Details of the DMC, including objectives, composition, scope, and frequency, will be
described in a DMC charter.
6.1.4.
Tumor Assessment
Tumor assessments using radiologic imaging will be performed after every even cycle (ie,
approximately every 6 weeks) for the first 9 months of the study and after every third cycle
(ie, approximately every 9 weeks) thereafter while receiving study drug. Tumor assessments
will include tumor response based on RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST. For tumor assessment, all
sites of disease should be assessed radiologically by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) at screening and every scheduled tumor assessment until the
occurrence of disease progression. CT or MRI scans obtained as standard of care prior to
informed consent will not need to be repeated if performed within 14 days prior to dosing.
Brain scans performed as standard of care prior to informed consent will not need to be
repeated if performed within 28 days prior to dosing. Assessments should be performed
within 7 days prior to starting the subsequent cycle. Additional scans may be obtained at the
discretion of the investigator, if clinically indicated. If a patient shows a radiological
response (CR or PR), a confirmatory radiological assessment will be performed at least
4 weeks after the response was first noted. For patients who have a confirmed CR, it is
strongly recommended that they receive prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) after
completion of chemotherapy (ie, induction). Patients with a confirmed PR should also
consider PCI after completion of chemotherapy (ie, induction) based on the investigator’s
judgment (see Section 8.8). Following the completion of the induction part, PCI may be
administered concurrently with atezolizumab during the maintenance part. For those patients
who have not progressed at the time of study drug discontinuation, tumor assessments to
include all sites of disease, will be assessed radiologically by CT or MRI, as performed at
screening, every 2 months (approximately 60 ± 7 days) until the occurrence of progressive
disease or study completion. The same method of assessment (CT or MRI) should be used to
characterize tumors at screening and at all follow-up assessments. If positron emission

TREATMENTS
8.1.
Treatments Administered
In the induction part of the study, patients will receive trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 or placebo
administered IV once daily on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day E/P/A therapy cycle (up to
4 cycles in total). In the maintenance part of the study, patients will receive atezolizumab
every 21 days.
Patients will receive E/P/A therapy in 21-day cycles during the induction part of the study.
The carboplatin dose will be calculated using the Calvert formula with a target AUC = 5
(maximum 750 mg) IV over 30 minutes on Day 1, and 100 mg/m2 etoposide will be
administered IV over 60 minutes daily on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle.
Atezolizumab 1200 mg in 250 mL sodium chloride solution 0.9% will be administered as an
IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle in both the induction and maintenance parts.
Atezolizumab should be infused over 60 minutes for the first administration and, if tolerated,
all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 minutes. Atezolizumab should be
administered following the completion of administration of trilaciclib or placebo, etoposide,
and carboplatin.
There will be no intrapatient dose modifications of trilaciclib or atezolizumab during the
study. Dose modifications allowed for E/P are described in Section 8.4.5.
The interval between doses of trilaciclib or placebo on successive days should not be
greater than 28 hours. The interval between the dose of trilaciclib or placebo and the
first dose of chemotherapy on a given day (etoposide or carboplatin) should not be
greater than 4 hours.
Trilaciclib or placebo will only be administered with E/P therapy. If administration of
E/P therapy is held or discontinued, trilaciclib or placebo will also be held or
discontinued.
Chemotherapy cannot be administered until after completion of the trilaciclib or
placebo infusion. If the second or third dose of trilaciclib or placebo in any given cycle
is not administered for any reason, do not administer the dose of etoposide
chemotherapy on that day, since this could potentially exacerbate myelosuppression
(see Section 4.5).
In both parts of the study, study drug administration will continue until disease progression
per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation by
investigator. Following disease progression per RECIST v1.1, if the patient appears to be
deriving clinical benefit, the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient, and
the patient has provided re-consent, study drug administration may be continued until loss of
clinical benefit (see Section 11.1.4). Treatment cycles will occur consecutively without
interruption, except when necessary to manage toxicities or for up to a 2-week delay for
administrative reasons; however, a total delay of more than 9 weeks for trilaciclib or placebo
+E/P, or 15 weeks for atezolizumab must be discussed with the medical monitor. If the
subsequent cycle is delayed, the patient should still complete the clinical laboratory

8.4.3.
Etoposide and Carboplatin
Etoposide and carboplatin will be administered IV in accordance with the prescribing
information (see Appendix 4) and according to the study site’s standard practice.
Needles or IV administration sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with
carboplatin should not be used for the preparation or administration of the drug. Aluminum
can react with carboplatin causing precipitate formation and loss of potency.
The interval between the dose of trilaciclib or placebo and the first dose of
chemotherapy on a given day (etoposide or carboplatin) should not be greater than
4 hours.
Chemotherapy cannot be administered until after completion of the trilaciclib or
placebo infusion. If the second or third dose of trilaciclib in any given cycle is not
administered for any reason, do not administer the dose of etoposide chemotherapy on
that day, since this could potentially exacerbate myelosuppression (see Section 4.5).
8.4.3.1.
Carboplatin
The carboplatin dose will be calculated using the Calvert formula with a target AUC = 5 on
Day 1 of each 21-day cycle and administered as an IV infusion over 30 to 60 minutes (per
institutional standard of care). The Calvert formula is as follows:
Total carboplatin dose (mg) = (target AUC) × (GFR + 25)
Because the estimated GFR may be based on serum creatinine measurements obtained using
standardized isotope dilution mass spectrometry, the dose of carboplatin should be capped
at 750 mg to avoid potential toxicity due to overdosing. The cap dose of 750 mg for
carboplatin is based on a GFR estimate that is capped at 125 mL/min for patients with normal
renal function (ie, maximum carboplatin dose = target AUC of 5 mg•min/mL × 150 mL/min
= 750 mg).
The weight used for calculation of GFR using the Cockcroft-Gault equation should be the
actual body weight (and not ideal body weight).
Refer to the carboplatin prescribing information (see Appendix 4) for details regarding
preparation, administration, instructions and precautions. Premedications may be provided
per local standard of care.
8.4.3.2.
Etoposide
Etoposide 100 mg/m2 will be administered as an IV infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1, 2,
and 3 of each 21-day cycle.
Refer to the etoposide prescribing information (see Appendix 4) for details regarding
preparation, administration, instructions, and precautions.

8.4.4.
Atezolizumab
Atezolizumab 1200 mg will be administered as an IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day
cycle. The first dose should be administered over 60 minutes and, if it is tolerated,
subsequent doses may be administered over 30 minutes. For the first 4 cycles, ie, during the
induction part, atezolizumab should be administered following the administration of
trilaciclib or placebo, etoposide and carboplatin.
Refer to the atezolizumab prescribing information (see Appendix 2) for details regarding
preparation, administration, instructions, and precautions.
8.4.5.
Dose Modifications
8.4.5.1.
Trilaciclib
To ensure the greatest level of safety when trilaciclib is coadministered with
chemotherapeutic agents, the magnitude and duration of trilaciclib-induced HSPC arrest was
simulated using a PK/pharmacodynamic model and verified by performing bone marrow cell
cycle analysis before or after administration of trilaciclib IV at 192 mg/m2 to different groups
of human subjects in the Phase 1a Study G1T28-1-01. Trilaciclib at a dose of 192 mg/m2
(rounded to 200 mg/m2 for this study) demonstrated robust bone marrow HSPC arrest for
> 24 hours and was determined to be the BED (Section 4.3.1). It is unknown if lower doses
will produce the same magnitude and duration of HSPC cell cycle arrest. Insufficient HSPC
arrest (ie, for too short a duration) could result in the release of HSPCs into the S (DNA
synthesis) phase of the cell cycle while chemotherapy is present, thereby potentially
exacerbating myelosuppression. However, higher doses of trilaciclib (240 and 280 mg/m2)
have been tested in patients with SCLC. Based on the Phase 1b results from these subsequent
Phase 1b/2a SCLC studies (G1T28-02 [administered prior to etoposide and carboplatin] and
G1T28-03 [administered prior to topotecan]), trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 was chosen as the
recommended Phase 2 dose. Therefore, to minimize this risk of an insufficient HSPC
arrest, the dose of trilaciclib will not be modified and will remain at 240 mg/m2
throughout the study.
8.4.5.2.
Modification of Etoposide and Carboplatin Dosing
Patients should meet the laboratory parameter requirements outlined in Section 10.3.2 before
initiation of Cycle 2 and each subsequent cycle of E/P therapy. All nonhematologic
drug-related toxicities (except alopecia) should have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline before
initiation of the next cycle of E/P therapy.
Dose adjustments are to be made according to the organ system showing the greatest degree
of drug-related toxicity. Toxicities will be graded using NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03. Initiation
of the next cycle of trilaciclib or placebo + E/P therapy may be delayed by no more than
9 weeks to allow recovery from toxicity due to the chemotherapy agents. A treatment delay
of > 9 weeks due to trilaciclib or placebo + E/P toxicity will lead to discontinuation of
trilaciclib or placebo + E/P therapy.
No more than 2 dose reductions of E/P in total are allowed for any patient. Simultaneous
reduction in the doses of etoposide and carboplatin will count as 1 dose reduction. Toxicity

that requires dose reduction more than twice will lead to discontinuation of trilaciclib or
placebo + E/P therapy. Under this circumstance, administration of trilaciclib or placebo
should also be discontinued. All dose reductions are permanent and no dose increases are
allowed.
Since fatigue can be a symptom of cancer progression, dose reduction will only be performed
if it is deemed to be drug-related in the opinion of the investigator.
The dose reductions in Table 8-1 will be utilized for the purpose of dose modifications for
toxicity.

In order to start Induction Cycle 2 and subsequent induction cycles as scheduled, on Day 1 of
the cycle, patients must have an ANC ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelet count ≥100 × 109/L, and
nonhematologic drug-related toxicities (except alopecia) must be ≤Grade 1 or have returned
to baseline. The dose adjustments in Table 8-2 are based on the ANC and platelet counts on
the first day of treatment for Cycle 2 and each subsequent induction cycle.

Colony Stimulating Factors
Patients will not receive colony stimulating factors (CSFs; eg, granulocyte colony
stimulating factor [G-CSF]; granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
[GM-CSF]) or erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) during Induction Cycle 1 (ie,
prior to the actual Cycle 2 Day 1 dosing visit).
Although CSFs should not be routinely used as adjunctive treatment with antibiotic therapy
for patients with fever and neutropenia in any cycle, they may be considered in patients with
fever and neutropenia who are at high risk for infection-associated complications or who
have prognostic factors predictive of poor clinical outcomes (including in Induction Cycle 1
if necessary). Subsequent use after Induction Cycle 1 will be based on toxicities as outlined
above. Please also refer to the ASCO guidelines (Smith 2015) for neutropenia.
When indicated, as outlined above in Table 8-2 and Table 8-3, either filgrastim or
pegfilgrastim may be used per the prescribing information. In the event a patient has a
neutropenic event requiring G-CSF in the subsequent cycle, then filgrastim or pegfilgrastim
should not be initiated until at least 24 hours after dosing of the next subsequent cycle is
complete (ie, no earlier than Day 4 of the next subsequent cycle). Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim
should not be used to increase low neutrophil counts mid-cycle or prior to the start of the
subsequent cycle.
For a hemoglobin level < 9.0 g/dL or symptomatic anemia when indicated, epoetin alfa or
darbepoetin alfa may be used to treat patients per the prescribing information.

For patients enrolled with baseline AST and ALT ≥3 × ULN in the presence of liver
metastases, if further increase in AST and ALT occurs, trilaciclib or placebo + E/P should be
held until the patient is discussed with the medical monitor.
Gastrointestinal toxicity
Nausea and vomiting should be managed with the use of adequate antiemetic therapy.
Prophylactic anti-emetic therapy can be used at the discretion of the treating physician.
Dexamethasone should be avoided as an antiemetic, if possible. Patients are encouraged to
take plenty of oral fluids.
Diarrhea should be managed with appropriate antidiarrheal therapy. Patients should be
encouraged to take plenty of oral fluids.
Hypersensitivity Reactions
For patients who had a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction and have been successfully
re-challenged, careful attention to prophylaxis and bedside monitoring of vital signs is
recommended for all subsequent doses.
Mild symptoms (eg, mild flushing, rash, pruritus): complete infusion. Supervise at bedside.
No treatment required.
Moderate symptoms (eg, moderate rash, flushing, mild dyspnea, chest discomfort): stop
infusion. Give IV diphenhydramine 25 mg and IV dexamethasone 10 mg. Resume infusion
after recovery of symptoms at a low rate, 20 mg/hour. If no further symptoms occur after
15 minutes, the rate may be increased to the full rate until the infusion is complete. If
symptoms recur, the infusion must be stopped. The patient should receive no additional
etoposide or carboplatin for that cycle, but may receive additional doses at the discretion of
the investigator.
Severe life-threatening symptoms (eg, hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy,
angioedema, respiratory distress requiring bronchodilation therapy, generalized urticarial):
stop infusion immediately. Give IV diphenhydramine and dexamethasone as above. Add
epinephrine or bronchodilators if indicated. If wheezing is present, that is not responsive to
bronchodilators, epinephrine is recommended. Patient should not receive any further doses of
etoposide or carboplatin. Report this occurrence as an AE.

Other Toxicities
For the first occurrence of any nonhematologic Grade 2 chemotherapy-related toxicity
(except alopecia), trilaciclib or placebo + E/P should be withheld until the toxicity recovers
to Grade 1 or baseline. Treatment may then be resumed at the same dose level. For the
second occurrence of any nonhematologic Grade 2 chemotherapy-related toxicity (except
alopecia), following recovery of the toxicity to Grade 1 or baseline, E/P should be resumed at
dose level -1; for the third occurrence, the E/P doses should be reduced to dose level -2. A
fourth occurrence will result in discontinuation of trilaciclib or placebo + E/P therapy. No
dose reduction should be made for Grade 1 toxicities.
For any Grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy-related toxicities not mentioned above, trilaciclib or
placebo + E/P should be withheld until the toxicity recovers to Grade 1 or baseline.
Treatment should then be resumed at dose level -1 for the first occurrence and dose level -2
for the second occurrence. A third occurrence will result in discontinuation of trilaciclib or
placebo + E/P therapy.
8.4.5.3.
Atezolizumab
A list of the AESI for atezolizumab is provided in Appendix 3 and these should be reported
using the same process and timeline as SAE reporting (see Section 11.4.1.10).
No dose reductions will be allowed for atezolizumab during the study. Management of irAEs
may include administration of corticosteroids, delay of a scheduled dose, or discontinuation
of therapy. Please refer to the Atezolizumab Guidance for the Investigator (Appendix 1) and
the full atezolizumab prescribing information (Appendix 2) for guidance on the management
of irAEs.
Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following: IRRs; immune-related
hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis; diabetes mellitus; hypothyroidism;
hyperthyroidism; adrenal insufficiency; Guillain-Barré syndrome; myasthenic syndrome or
myasthenia gravis; hypophysitis; and meningoencephalitis. In addition, systemic immune
activation is a potential risk associated with atezolizumab when given in combination with
other immunomodulating agents. Refer to the Atezolizumab Guidance for the Investigator
(Appendix 1) for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab and their
management.
For patients enrolled with baseline AST and ALT ≥3 x ULN in the presence of liver
metastases, if further increase in AST and ALT occurs, atezolizumab should be held until the
patient is discussed with the medical monitor.
Systemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by an excessive immune
response. Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, systemic immune activation is
considered a potential risk when given in combination with other immunomodulating agents.
Systemic immune activation should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients who,
in the absence of an alternative etiology, develop a sepsis-like syndrome after administration
of atezolizumab, and the initial evaluation should include the following:

Other irAEs attributed to atezolizumab not listed above should be assessed by the
investigator and discussed with the medical monitor to determine if atezolizumab should be
held or discontinued.
If corticosteroids have been initiated as part of the irAE management, they must be tapered
over ≥1 month to ≤10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent before atezolizumab can be
resumed. If the delay for re-starting atezolizumab is > 15 weeks for recovery from
immune-related toxicities attributed to atezolizumab (12 weeks for recovery to ≤Grade 1 and
up to an additional 3 weeks for steroid taper of oral prednisone or equivalent to
≤10 mg/day), atezolizumab will be permanently discontinued.
Discontinuation or interruption of trilaciclib or placebo + E/P does not preclude
continuation of atezolizumab and vice versa. For instance, if an AE is attributed to
trilaciclib or placebo, etoposide, or carboplatin (eg, hematologic toxicity) during the
induction part of the study, then atezolizumab will be continued while the trilaciclib or
placebo + E/P are held. While the trilaciclib or placebo + E/P are held, the patient will
continue to receive atezolizumab, be monitored for safety (see Section 10.3.4), and will
begin the next trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A-containing induction cycle after the
toxicity resolves. If the AE is immune related and attributed to atezolizumab; then
trilaciclib or placebo + E/P will be continued for up to 4 induction cycles while the
atezolizumab is held.
8.5.
Randomization and Blinding
The study is randomized and blinded. Patients meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria
will be randomized 1:1 to receive trilaciclib or placebo with E/P/A therapy by an IWRS
according to a randomization schedule generated by an unblinded statistician. Randomization
will be stratified by ECOG performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) and presence of brain
metastases (yes versus no). Each patient will be assigned a unique randomization number,
which will not be reused.
Each site will have an unblinded pharmacist/designee, who will have access to the treatment
assignment to label and distribute the blinded study drug. The patients, investigators, other
site staff involved in the clinical care of the patients, and the sponsor or designees involved in
the conduct of the study will not be aware of the treatment group to which a particular patient
has been randomized. If an investigator determines that a patient’s assignment should be
unblinded for reasons of safety, this should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to
unblinding, unless an urgent and immediate intervention is required that precludes this
discussion. If unblinding of the treatment assignment is necessary, the investigator will

obtain the treatment assignment details from the IWRS. Any unplanned unblinding must be
communicated to the project manager and study statistician for documentation in the study
files and the clinical study report.
8.6.
Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures
All concomitant medications including prescription medications, over-the-counter
preparations, growth factors, blood products, and parenteral nutrition taken during the
14 days before the date of enrollment, during the study treatment, and through 30 days after
the last dose of study drug will be documented. Documentation will include information
regarding start and stop dates, dose(s), and reasons for the medication use.
Administration of other concomitant nonprotocol anticancer therapies prior to progression is
not permitted while on this study.
Administration of other concomitant investigational agents for any indication is not permitted
while on this study.
Palliative radiation therapy or surgery is allowed to control disease symptoms but not to aid
in the response of the tumor and patients requiring palliative radiation may continue
receiving study drug administration if they meet the requirements described in
Section 11.1.4. However, for patients who have not had disease progression, the requirement
for palliative radiation therapy or surgery will be regarded as disease progression.
Caution should be exercised when administering etoposide phosphate with drugs that are
known to inhibit phosphatase activities (eg, levamisole hydrochloride). Although carboplatin
has limited nephrotoxic potential, caution should be exercised when administering
carboplatin with aminoglycosides, which has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic
toxicity. Any medication that is contraindicated when using etoposide or carboplatin is not
permitted, and special warnings and precautions for use of carboplatin and etoposide should
be observed.
Necessary supportive care such as antiemetics, antidiarrheals, etc., per the standard of care at
the study center will be permitted. Administration of hematopoietic growth factors in
Induction Cycle 1 will not be permitted (ie, no growth factors should be used prior to
the actual Induction Cycle 2 Day 1 dosing visit; Section 8.4.5.2). However, hematopoietic
growth factors may be utilized in subsequent cycles at the investigator’s discretion as stated
in Section 8.4.5.2. To reduce potential immune system interactions, the use of
dexamethasone as an antiemetic should be minimized where possible.
For the purposes of this trial, concomitant medications like bisphosphonates and denosumab,
which are used to prevent skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastases, are
allowed as long as the patient has been on stable doses for at least 4 weeks.
Trilaciclib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and is a substrate for CYP3A4.
Trilaciclib exposure may be altered by concomitant use of drugs that are strong CYP3A
inhibitors or inducers. The exposure of drugs that are CYP3A substrates may be altered by
concomitant use of trilaciclib (Section 4.4.2).

Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of drugs that are strong CYP3A
inhibitors (eg, aprepitant, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone,
posaconazole, telithromycin, verapamil, and voriconazole).
•
Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of drugs that are strong or
moderate CYP3A inducers (eg, phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, St John’s Wort,
bosentan, modafinil, and nafcillin).
•
Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of drugs that are extensively
metabolized by CYP3A.
Trilaciclib is a potent inhibitor of MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT2 membrane transporters and
therefore caution should be exercised with concomitant use of drugs that are substrates for
these transporters (Section 4.4.2).
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, as well as conjugation/glucuronidation reactions, are not
involved in the metabolism of atezolizumab. No drug interaction studies for atezolizumab
have been conducted. There are no known interactions with other medicinal products or other
form of interactions (Section 1.10 of the Atezolizumab Guidance for the Investigator,
Appendix 1).
Atezolizumab should not be given to patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment
with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to cyclophosphamide,
azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-TNF agents) within 14 days of
atezolizumab administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses
> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune
disease.
Any diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures performed during the study period will be
documented. Documentation will include information regarding the date(s), indication(s),
description of the procedure(s), and any clinical or pathological findings.
Medications will be coded using the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) Drug
Dictionary version.
8.7.
Transfusions
Platelets should be transfused at a threshold of ≤10,000/µL. Platelets should also be
transfused in any patient who is bleeding with a platelet count < 50,000/µL (100,000/µL for
central nervous system or ocular bleeding). Please also refer to the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines (Schiffer 2001).
Patients with hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL or with symptomatic anemia can be treated with RBC
transfusions at the investigators discretion.

Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation
Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients without detectable brain metastases has been
shown to decrease the frequency of subsequent intracranial relapse and improve survival for
patients with SCLC (Aupérin A 1999; Slotman 2007). Therefore, patients with a confirmed
CR are strongly encouraged to receive PCI after completion of induction chemotherapy.
Patients with a confirmed PR should also consider PCI after completion of induction
chemotherapy based on the investigator’s judgment. Following the completion of the
induction part, PCI may be administered concurrently with atezolizumab during the
maintenance part.
8.9.
Treatment Compliance
The investigator or designee will dispense the study drugs, via an unblinded
pharmacist/designee, only for use by patients enrolled in the study as described in this
protocol. The study drugs are not to be used for reasons other than those described in this
protocol. The investigator or other study staff will supervise each dose of the study drugs
administered in the clinic. The clinical study site will maintain records of study drugs receipt,
preparation, and dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers; patient’s height, body
weight, and BSA; date and time of the start and end of each trilaciclib or placebo, etoposide,
carboplatin, and atezolizumab infusion; and total drug administered in milligrams. Any
discrepancy between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for the
discrepancy will be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF) and in the source

STUDY FLOWCHART
The procedures and assessments to be performed during the study are outlined in Table 9-1.
The timing and number of samples collected for PK, immunologic markers and
anti-atezolizumab antibody testing may be altered based on emerging data without requiring
an amendment if the blood volume/day or overall does not increase and the patient is not
required to have additional clinic visits or prolongation of a clinic visit, ie, the risk-benefit
profile for the patient does not worsen. The investigators and institutional review boards
(IRBs) or Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) will be notified if the frequency is reduced.

SCHEDULE OF STUDY PROCEDURES
Study procedures are summarized across all study visits within the schedule of assessments
(Table 9-1).
10.1.
Screening
Patients should be screened no more than 14 days before the first dose of study treatment is
administered. Written informed consent must be obtained from each patient before the
initiation of any screening procedures. Informed consent and brain scans may be obtained up
to 28 days prior to the first study treatment administration. After a patient has given informed
consent, eligibility will be determined by a review of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and
completion of all screening procedures outlined in Table 9-1 and listed below.
•
Collection of demographics
•
Collection of medical history
•
ECOG performance status evaluation
•

Vital signs should be obtained within 15 minutes before and after trilaciclib or placebo,
etoposide, and carboplatin infusions; only once between infusions; and after the last infusion
on Days 1 and 3.
In order to start Induction Cycle 2 as scheduled, on Day 1 of the cycle, patients must have an
ANC ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelet count ≥100 × 109/L, and nonhematologic drug-related toxicities
(except alopecia) must be ≤Grade 1 or have returned to baseline. Dose modifications based
on lack of recovery to these absolute neutrophil and platelet counts on the first day of
treatment for Cycle 2 are outlined in Table 8-2. A delay of up to 9 weeks is permitted to allow
recovery from any toxicity related to trilaciclib or placebo, carboplatin, or etoposide in order
to meet the continuation criteria. A delay of up to 15 weeks is permitted to allow recovery
and management from immune-related toxicities attributed to atezolizumab (12 weeks for
recovery to ≤Grade 1 and up to an additional 3 weeks for steroid taper of oral prednisone or
equivalent to ≤10 mg/day). If the patient meets the criteria for starting the subsequent cycle
as stated in protocol Section 6.1.1, a delay of up to 2 weeks is permitted for administrative
reasons (eg, holiday, vacation, etc.); however, a total delay of more than 9 weeks for
trilaciclib or placebo + E/P, or 15 weeks for atezolizumab must be discussed with the medical
monitor. If a cycle is delayed, the patient should still complete the clinical laboratory
assessments and the FACT-L and FACT-An questionnaires on the scheduled Day 1 of the
next cycle, as well as the actual first dosing day of the next cycle of trilaciclib or placebo +
E/P/A chemotherapy.
A delay of > 9 weeks for recovery from any toxicity related to trilaciclib or placebo + E/P in
order to meet the continuation criteria will result in discontinuation of trilaciclib or placebo +
E/P. A delay of > 15 weeks for recovery and management of immune-related toxicities
attributed to atezolizumab (12 weeks for recovery to ≤Grade 1 and up to an additional
3 weeks for steroid taper of oral prednisone or equivalent to ≤10 mg/day) will result in
discontinuation of atezolizumab (see Section 8.4.5.3).
For patients who are eligible to initiate Induction Cycle 2, study treatments (trilaciclib or
placebo + etoposide + carboplatin + atezolizumab) will be administered as described in
Section 8.1.
Postdose assessments on Induction Cycle 2 Day 1 are as follows:
•
Vital signs (obtained within 15 minutes before and after trilaciclib or placebo, etoposide,
carboplatin, and atezolizumab infusions; only needed once between infusions; and after
the last infusion on Days 1 and 3)
•
Plasma PK sample (postdose sample for measurement of atezolizumab concentration as
described in Section 11.2, for all patients)
Induction Cycle 2 Days 2, 3, 8, and 15
All procedures and assessments to be conducted during Induction Cycle 2 Days 2, 3, 8, and
15 are outlined in Table 9-1. The DMC may recommend decreasing the frequency of
hematological evaluations based on accumulating data. The investigators and IRBs will be

For tumor assessment, all sites of disease should be assessed radiologically by CT or MRI at
screening and after every even cycle for the first 9 months of the study (ie, approximately
every 6 weeks) and after every third cycle (ie, approximately every 9 weeks) thereafter, until
the occurrence of disease progression. Additional scans may be obtained at the discretion of
the investigator, if clinically indicated. If a patient shows a radiological response (CR or PR),
a confirmatory radiological assessment will be performed at least 4 weeks after the response
was first noted. The same method of assessment (CT or MRI) should be used to characterize
tumors at screening and at all follow-up assessments.
10.3.3.
Induction Cycles 3 and 4
Procedures and assessments to be performed during Induction Cycle 3 are similar to
Induction Cycle 1 (see Section 10.3.1 and Table 9-1).
Procedures and assessments to be performed during Induction Cycle 4 are similar to
Induction Cycle 2 (see Section 10.3.2 and Table 9-1).
In order to start Induction Cycles 3 and 4 as scheduled, on Day 1 of the cycle, patients must
have an ANC ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelet count ≥100 × 109/L, and nonhematologic drug-related
toxicities (except alopecia) must be ≤Grade 1 or have returned to baseline. Dose

attributed to atezolizumab (12 weeks for recovery to ≤Grade 1 and up to an additional
3 weeks for steroid taper of oral prednisone or equivalent to ≤10 mg/day) will result in
discontinuation of atezolizumab (see Section 8.4.5.3).
10.3.4.
Atezolizumab Administration While Trilaciclib or Placebo + E/P Is Held
During the induction part, interruption or delay of trilaciclib or placebo + E/P does not
preclude continuation of atezolizumab and vice versa. If the AE is immune related and
attributed to atezolizumab, then trilaciclib or placebo + E/P will be continued for up to
4 cycles while atezolizumab is held. If an AE is attributed to trilaciclib or placebo, etoposide,
or carboplatin (eg, hematologic toxicity) during the induction part of the study, then
atezolizumab will be continued every 21 days while trilaciclib or placebo + E/P are held.
During the period in which trilaciclib or placebo + E/P are held and atezolizumab is
continued, patients should be monitored as follows prior to administering atezolizumab every
21 days:
•
ECOG performance status evaluation
•
Physical examination
•
Weight and vital signs measurements
•
Clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests (note: clinical chemistry and
urinalysis tests may be obtained up to 72 hours prior to the first dose of each cycle of
study treatments, and hematology tests may be obtained up to 24 hours prior to the first
dose of each cycle of study treatments). The clinical chemistry and hematology results
should be reviewed before dosing.
•
FACT-L and FACT-An Questionnaires
10.4.
Last Induction Cycle – Day 22
On Day 22 of the last induction cycle, patients will return to the clinic for ECG assessment
and collection of a blood sample for hematology tests.
•
If the patient continues directly into maintenance without interruption, then the
hematology and ECG assessments will be performed as part of the Day 1 assessments
in the first cycle of atezolizumab maintenance.
•
If atezolizumab is held or discontinued for any reason after the last cycle of
trilaciclib/placebo with carboplatin and etoposide, the patient should return to the
clinic at the end (eg, Day 22) of this last induction cycle for hematology and ECG
assessments.
Adverse events and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study. AEs
and concomitant medications will be collected through 30 days after the last dose of study
drug; SAEs and AESI will be collected through 90 days after the last dose of study drug.
For patients who have a confirmed CR, it is strongly recommended that they receive PCI
after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with a confirmed partial response should also
consider PCI after completion of chemotherapy based on the investigator’s judgment.

10.5.
Maintenance Part of the Study
Following induction, patients will proceed to the maintenance part of the study and receive
atezolizumab every 21 days. Treatment in the maintenance part of the study will continue
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation by
investigator. Following disease progression per RECIST v1.1, if the patient appears to be
deriving clinical benefit, the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient, and
the patient has provided re-consent, study drug administration may be continued until loss of
clinical benefit.

Maintenance Cycle 1 and Odd Cycles
Adverse events and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study. AEs
and concomitant medications will be collected through 30 days after the last dose of study
drug; SAEs and AESI will be collected through 90 days after the last dose of study drug.
Maintenance Cycle 1 and Odd Cycles – Day 1
Patients will return to the study center on study Day 1 of Maintenance Cycle 1 and odd
cycles in the maintenance part of the study. The following procedures will be performed and
results reviewed before study drug administration:
•
ECOG performance status evaluation
•
Physical examination
•

randomized to the study have died. In addition, for patients who have not had disease
progression at the time of study drug discontinuation, tumor assessments, including all sites
of disease, will be assessed radiologically by CT or MRI, as performed at screening, every
2 months (approximately 60 ± 7 days) until the occurrence of progressive disease or study
completion.
The following information will be collected monthly for all patients:
•
Survival status
•
Details of any anticancer treatment
10.8.
Study Drug Discontinuation
After discontinuation of study drug, patients should be strongly encouraged to complete all
scheduled assessments through the end of their current 21-day treatment cycle,
CBC assessment on Day 22; the Post-Treatment
Visits; and the Survival Follow-up Phase of the study, which is to continue until at least 70%
of randomized patients have died. Any abnormal results that are believed to be related to the
study drug treatment should be repeated as often as deemed appropriate by the investigator
until the abnormality resolves, returns to predose levels, or is otherwise explained.

STUDY ASSESSMENTS
11.1.
Tumor Response
Efficacy evaluation will be based on tumor response using RECIST v1.1, including objective
response rate (ORR), PFS, and OS. Additionally, tumor response and immune-related
progression-free survival (irPFS) will be assessed using irRECIST.
11.1.1.
Tumor Assessments
For tumor assessment, all sites of disease should be assessed radiologically by CT or MRI at
screening and after every even cycle for the first 9 months of the study (ie, approximately
every 6 weeks) and after every third cycle (ie, approximately every 9 weeks) thereafter while
receiving study drug, until the occurrence of disease progression (see Table 9-1). CT or MRI
scans obtained prior to informed consent will not need to be repeated if performed within 14
days prior to dosing. Brain scans performed as standard of care prior to informed consent will
not need to be repeated if performed within 28 days prior to dosing. Assessments should be
performed within 7 days prior to starting the subsequent cycle. Additional scans may be
obtained at the discretion of the investigator, if clinically indicated. If a patient shows a
radiological response (CR or PR), a confirmatory radiological assessment will be performed
at least 4 weeks after the response was first noted. For patients who have a confirmed CR, it
is strongly recommended that they receive PCI after completion of chemotherapy. Patients
with a confirmed PR should also consider PCI after completion of chemotherapy based on
the investigator’s judgment (see Section 8.8). Following the completion of the induction part,
PCI may be administered concurrently with atezolizumab during the maintenance part. For
those patients who have not progressed at the time of study drug discontinuation, tumor
assessments, including all sites of disease, will be assessed radiologically by CT or MRI, as
performed at screening, every 2 months (approximately 60 ± 7 days) until the occurrence of
progressive disease or study completion.
The same method of assessment (CT or MRI) should be used to characterize tumors at
screening and at all follow-up assessments. If PET is used, it should also be accompanied by
spiral CT or MRI.
Investigators should follow the RECIST v1.1 guidelines (Eisenhauer 2009) for tumor
assessments.
11.1.2.
Tumor Lesions: Identification and Follow-up
11.1.2.1.
Measurable Lesions
Measurable tumor lesions are defined as tumor lesions with a longest diameter (measured in
at least 1 dimension) with a minimum size as follows (Eisenhauer 2009):
•
10 mm by CT or MRI (with a scan slice thickness of no greater than 5 mm)

Measurable lymph nodes must be ≥15 mm on the short axis by CT or MRI (with a scan slice
thickness of no greater than 5 mm); only the short axis is to be measured at baseline and
follow-up.
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions with a soft tissue component meeting the
definition of measurability above can be considered measurable lesions. Cystic lesions
representing cystic metastases that meet the definition of measurability described above can
be considered measurable lesions. If present, noncystic lesions should be selected as target
lesions for this study.
A tumor lesion that has been previously irradiated may be considered measurable if
unequivocal growth of the lesion has been demonstrated.
Target lesions: At baseline, up to 5 measurable tumor lesions/lymph nodes (with a
maximum of 2 lesions per organ) should be identified as target lesions that will be followed
to quantitate the status of disease during the study. Lesions with the longest diameter, that are
representative of all involved organs, and for which reproducible repeated measurements can
be obtained should be selected as the target lesions.
At baseline and each follow-up time point (see Table 9-1), each target lesion should be
measured and the overall tumor burden will be calculated as the sum of the diameters of the
target lesions (longest diameter [LD] for tumor lesions and short axis for lymph nodes) and
documented in the eCRF. If a target lesion fragments into multiple smaller lesions, the LDs
of all fragmented portions are added to the sum of the diameters. If multiple lesions coalesce,
the LD of the coalesced lesion will be included in the sum of the diameters.
11.1.2.2.
Nonmeasurable Lesions
Nonmeasurable lesions include tumor lesions with a longest diameter < 10 mm, lymph nodes
with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis, or nonmeasurable lesions such as leptomeningeal disease,
ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic
involvement of skin or lung, or abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by
physical exam that is not measurable by CT scan or MRI (Eisenhauer 2009).
Nontarget lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) identified at baseline should be
identified as nontarget lesions and recorded in the eCRF. Measurements of these lesions are
not required, but the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of each nontarget lesion
should be recorded in the eCRF at each follow-up time point. Multiple nontarget lesions in
the same organ may be noted as a single item on the eCRF.
11.1.2.3.
New Lesions
Any new lesions should be identified and recorded at each follow-up assessment, as these are
markers of disease progression. As defined in the RECIST v1.1 guidelines (Eisenhauer
2009), new lesions include the following:
•
A lesion in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline

•
Equivocal new lesion of small size that with continued therapy and follow-up is found to
progress and represent new disease (progression should be considered as of the date of
the initial scan)
•
Negative positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose
(FDG-PET) at baseline, but has a positive FDG-PET at follow-up
•
No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up that corresponds to a new
site of disease as confirmed by CT (date of disease progression should be the date of the
initial abnormal FDG-PET scan)
Note: Findings attributable to differences in scanning technique or a change in type of
imaging (CT versus MRI) and findings representing something other than tumor (eg, healing
or flare of exiting bone lesions, necrosis of a liver lesion) should not be considered new
lesions.
11.1.3.
Definitions of Tumor Response and Disease Progression
The determination of SCLC tumor response and progression will be based on the
RECIST v1.1 criteria (Eisenhauer 2009). The definitions for tumor response per the
RECIST v1.1 criteria are as follows:
11.1.3.1.
Evaluation of Target Lesion Response
•
Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph
nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
•
Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
•
Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of 1 or more new
lesions is also considered progression.
•
Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.
A response category of not evaluable (NE) is to be used when there is inadequate information
to otherwise categorize the response status.
11.1.3.2.
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
•
Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of
tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be < 10 mm short axis.
•
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesions and/or maintenance of
tumor marker level above the normal limits.
•
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions or the
appearance of at least 1 new lesion.

11.1.3.3.
Evaluation of Overall Response
Patients who have at least 1 postdose tumor assessment (CT scan or MRI) will be considered
evaluable for tumor response.
Table 11-1 describes the evaluation of overall response at each time point based on target and
nontarget lesion responses at each time point, as well as the appearance of new lesions. The
best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until
disease progression. Confirmation of CR and PR is required as described in Sections 11.1.3.1
and 11.1.3.2.

Treatment Beyond Disease Progression Per RECIST Version 1.1
Evidence indicates some patients treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit
after initial evidence of apparent disease progression (Wolchok et al 2013; Nishino 2013).
Therefore, study drug administration may be continued until loss of clinical benefit, provided
the patient appears to be deriving clinical benefit, the investigator believes it is in the best
interest of the patient to continue and the patient has provided re-consent. Study drug
administration refers to trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A during the induction part or
atezolizumab during the maintenance part. Treatment past disease progression per
RECIST v1.1 should only be considered if a patient is clinically stable and has the following:
•
Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator
•
Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values; eg, new or
worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease
•
No decline in ECOG performance status that can be attributed to disease progression
•
Absence of tumor growth at critical anatomical sites (eg, leptomeningeal disease) that
cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions
•
All patients continuing treatment beyond progression must sign a separate written
consent to acknowledge deferring alternative potential treatment options in favor of
continuing study treatment at the time of initial apparent progression.
The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the subject is clinically
deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatment. Decisions to

continue treatment beyond initial progression per RECIST v1.1 may be discussed with the
medical monitor and should be documented in the study records.
Patients with radiographic disease progression confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment
may be considered for continued study treatment at the discretion of the investigator if they
continue to meet the criteria above and have evidence of clinical benefit.
Immune-related disease progression (irPD) must be confirmed with worsening of disease
bulk on the next tumor assessment, performed at least 4 weeks after the disease progression
by RECIST v 1.1 was first noted. If the criteria of worsening disease bulk are met on
2 consecutive scans, the patient is determined to have confirmed irPD. If following an initial
progression, the patient has a subsequent immune-related response (immune-related CR, PR
or SD; determined from baseline), then the original progression is not confirmed and the
patient may continue to receive study treatment and any subsequent progression must be
confirmed on the next consecutive tumor assessment.
Confirmation of progression due to worsening disease bulk is defined as an additional 20%
or greater increase in tumor burden volume from the time of initial RECIST v1.1 defined
progression (including all target lesions and new measurable lesions) or an unequivocal
further increase in nontarget lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. New lesions are considered
measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest diameter is at least 10 mm (except
for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). Any new
lesion considered nonmeasurable at the time of initial progression may become measurable
and therefore included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest diameter increases to
at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in short
axis to at least 15 mm).
For statistical analyses that include the investigator-assessed progression date, subjects who
continue treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed, RECIST v1.1-defined progression
will be considered to have investigator-assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial
progression event. For patients who continue on treatment beyond RECIST v1.1-defined
progression and have confirmed irPD, the date of the previous irPD will be recorded as the
irPFS date.
11.2.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
In a subgroup of at least 5 patients in each treatment group of the study, blood samples will
be collected for the measurement of trilaciclib, etoposide, and carboplatin concentrations in
plasma at the time points outlined below and in Table 9-1. The sites identified to participate
in the trilaciclib, etoposide, and carboplatin PK substudy will be based on the site’s ability to
complete all PK assessments. Sites will be identified during the site selection process. All
patients in each treatment group will have blood samples collected for the measurement of
atezolizumab plasma concentrations. Comprehensive information on blood sample
acquisition, the specific type of collection tube with anticoagulant, and handling and storage
are to be found in the Laboratory Manual. The analytical laboratory will measure plasma
concentrations of trilaciclib, etoposide, carboplatin, and atezolizumab using validated

methods. Any remaining samples may be stored long term (up to 10 years) for the future
analysis of trilaciclib drug metabolites.
Day 1 of Induction Cycles 1 and 3
Blood samples will be collected at the following time points on Day 1 of Induction Cycles 1
and 3 for all patients enrolled in the PK subgroup of the study: predose (0 hour; prior to
dosing of trilaciclib or placebo) and at 0.5 (end of infusion [EOI] of trilaciclib or placebo),
1 (EOI of carboplatin), 2 (EOI of etoposide), 4, 6, and 24 (prior to trilaciclib or placebo dose
on Day 2) hours. The EOI sample for trilaciclib or placebo should be drawn 2 to 5 minutes
prior to the EOI. The EOI samples for trilaciclib or placebo, carboplatin, and etoposide must
be drawn after completing infusion of the drugs and the actual times at which the samples
were drawn should be documented. A ± 5-minute time window will be allowed for samples
collected between the following time points: predose to 2 hours after the end of trilaciclib or
placebo infusion. A ± 10-minute time window will be allowed for samples collected between
the following time points: 4 to 6 hours after the end of trilaciclib or placebo infusion. A
± 1-hour time window will be allowed for the 24-hour time point. The actual time of blood
sample collection should be documented in the eCRF. The Induction Cycle 1 Day 1 sampling
scheme is summarized in Table 11-2.

11.4.1.
Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Events of Special
Interest
11.4.1.1.
Definition of Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal
product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can,
therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the study (investigational) product.
An abnormal laboratory value is not an AE unless it is considered to be clinically significant.
Adverse events include the following:
•
All suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
•
All reactions from medication overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity
•
Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a pre-existing illness (see
pre-existing conditions below)
•
Injury or accidents (Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or
accident [eg, a fall secondary to dizziness], the medical condition [dizziness] and the
accident [fall] should be reported as 2 separate AEs). The outcome of the accident (eg,
hip fracture secondary to the fall) should be recorded under comments.
•
Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination (findings that require
clinical intervention or further investigation beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test)
•
Laboratory abnormalities that are clinically significant and require clinical intervention or
further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are
associated with an already reported clinical event. Laboratory abnormalities associated
with a clinical event (eg, elevated liver enzymes in a patient with jaundice) should be
described under comments on the report of the clinical event rather than listed as a
separate AE.
An AE does not include:
•
Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion);
the condition that leads to the procedure will be an AE
•
Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that do not
worsen
•
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (eg, hospitalization
for elective surgery, social, and/or convenience admissions)
•
Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms
•
Disease progression

Trilaciclib (G1T28)

G1 Therapeutics CONFIDENTIAL
An unexpected AE is any AE that is not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the
current IB or product information.
•
An unexpected ADR is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not
consistent with the applicable product information (eg, IB for an unapproved
investigational medicinal product). All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal
product related to any dose should be considered ADRs. The phrase “responses to a
medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an
AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out. All serious
and unexpected ADRs will have expedited reporting to the regulatory agencies following
the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) requirements
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study and
every effort should be made to remain alert to possible AEs. Patients should be encouraged to
report AEs spontaneously or in response to general, nondirected questioning. Adverse events
should be reported on the appropriate page of the eCRF.
In the event of an AE, the primary concern is the safety of the patient. If necessary,
appropriate medical intervention should be provided, and the investigational drug
discontinued.
11.4.1.2.
Definition of Serious Adverse Event
The ICH topic E2A on Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for
Expedited Reporting defines an SAE as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
•
Results in death
•
Is life threatening
NOTE: The term "life threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
•
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
•
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting
(see Section 11.4.1.10) is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events
that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may
jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed
in the definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such
events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm;
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug
dependency or drug abuse.

G1 Therapeutics CONFIDENTIAL
To ensure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms
“serious” and “severe”, the following note of clarification is provided:
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with
events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as
a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.
11.4.1.3.
Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest for atezolizumab are defined in Appendix 3.
11.4.1.4.
Assessment of the Severity of Adverse Events
The severity (toxicity grade) of AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE,
Version 4.03 (see Appendix 5).
11.4.1.5.
Assessment of the Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug
The investigator will determine the assessment of the causal relationship of the AE to the
study drug. Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances
surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine
whether or not an AE is considered to be related to the study drug. The following guidance
should be taken into consideration when determining causality:
•
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
•
Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation
of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)
•
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
•
Known association of the event with the disease under study
•
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to
increase the occurrence of the event
•
Presence of nontreatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the
occurrence of the event
The following terms for assessment of the causality to study drug or study procedures are to
be used:
•
Unrelated: There is not a temporal relationship to study drug administration (eg, too
early, too late, or study drug not taken), or there is a reasonable causal relationship
between another drug, concurrent disease, or circumstance and the AE.
•
Unlikely Related: There is a temporal relationship to study drug administration, but there
is not a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE (ie, the AE is
doubtfully related to study drug).
•
Possibly Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and
the AE. Information related to withdrawal of study drug is lacking or unclear.

•
Probably Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and
the AE. The event responds to withdrawal of study drug. Re-challenge is not required.
•
Definitely Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and
the AE. The event responds to withdrawal of study drug, and recurs with re-challenge,
when clinically feasible.
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each
protocol-mandated therapy.
11.4.1.6.
Assessment of the Outcome of Adverse Events
The action taken for study drugs (eg, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, dose
interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, unknown) will be recorded on the eCRF.
Other actions (eg, none, concomitant medication given, new or prolonged hospitalization,
procedural surgery) will also be recorded on the eCRF.
The outcome will be assessed according to the following:
•
Fatal
•
Not recovered/not resolved
•
Recovered/resolved with sequelae
•
Recovering/resolving
•
Recovered/resolved
•
Unknown
11.4.1.7.
Method, Frequency, and Time Period for Detecting Adverse Events and
Serious Adverse Events
Safety surveillance reporting of AEs commences at the time of informed consent. AEs will
be collected through 30 days after the last dose of study drug; SAEs and AESI will be
collected through 90 days after the last dose of study drug.
11.4.1.8.
Documentation of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
All AEs will be documented in the appropriate section of the eCRF. The CTCAE, Version
4.03 grading scale referenced in Appendix 1 is provided to assist in categorizing and grading
AEs. All SAEs (see Section 11.4.1.2) will be additionally documented on the SAE report
form. For AEs occurring while the patient is in the clinic setting, ie, before, during, or after
study drug administration, the start time and stop time of the AE should be recorded in the
source document.
The following will be recorded for each AE in the eCRF:
•
A description of the AE in medical terms, not as reported by the patient. Whenever
possible, a diagnosis should be given when signs and symptoms are due to common
etiology (eg, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be
reported as “upper respiratory infection”).

•
Date of onset (start date)

Adverse Event Coding
Adverse event verbatim terms provided by the investigator will be coded by G1 Therapeutics
or its designee using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA) as specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).
11.4.1.10.
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events of Special Interest
The reporting period for SAEs and AESI (see Appendix 3) begins from the time of informed
consent through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment (safety follow-up phone call).
Any SAE that is thought to be related to the study drug or any AESI that occurs after the
reporting period must be reported within 24 hours of discovery of the SAE or AESI.
All SAEs and AESI must be entered into the eCRF and the initial SAE or AESI form should
be completed and sent to the safety team within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by
the study personnel.
In addition, any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the AE-reporting period
that the investigator assesses as related to the investigational medication should also be
reported as an AE.
11.4.1.11.
Follow-up of Adverse Events
All AEs (both serious and nonserious) will be followed up in accordance with good medical
practice until resolution, return to baseline, or it is deemed that further recovery is unlikely.
All measures required for AE management and the ultimate outcome of the AE will be
recorded in the source document and reported to the sponsor.
All unresolved AEs should be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the
patient is lost to follow-up, or the AE is otherwise explained, or further recovery is not
deemed to be feasible. At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each patient

Regulatory Aspects of Adverse Event Reporting
Unexpected serious adverse reactions are subject to expedited reporting to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and European National Competent Authorities, the Medicine
Evaluation Board, and the Competent Authorities in other Member States, if applicable, in an
expedited time frame in compliance with current legislation. The sponsor or its representative
will report all unexpected SAEs to the Competent Authority, the Medicine Evaluation Board,
and the Competent Authorities in other Member States, as applicable in an expedited time
frame.
All SAEs must be entered into the SAE form and sent to the medical monitor /drug safety
team within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by the study personnel.
The investigator is encouraged to discuss with the medical monitor any adverse experiences
for which the issue of reportability is unclear or questioned.
It is important that the investigator provide his/her assessment of relationship to study drug at
the time of the initial report. The following information must be reported on the eCRF SAE
report form:
•
Protocol number
•
Site and/or investigator number
•
Patient number
•
Demographic data
•
Brief description of the event
•
Onset date and time
•
Resolution date and time, if the event has resolved
•
Current status, if event has not yet resolved
•
Any concomitant treatment and medication
•
Investigator’s assessment of whether the SAE was related to investigative product or not
•
Outcome of the event if available
The medical monitor or member of the safety team will contact the site for clarification of
data entered in the eCRF, or to obtain missing information. In the event of questions
regarding SAE reporting, the site may contact the medical monitor or a member of the safety
team.
G1 Therapeutics, or their designee, and their collaborators are responsible for submitting
reports of AEs associated with the use of the study drug that are both serious and unexpected
to the FDA and European National Competent Authorities, the Medicine Evaluation Board,

and the Competent Authorities in other Member States, if applicable, in an expedited time
frame in compliance with current legislation. Unexpected SAEs that are already reported to
the European Medicines Agency Eudravigilance database do not have to be reported again to
the relevant authorities. All investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with the
study medication will receive copies of these reports for prompt submission to their IRB or
IEC.
The expedited reporting will occur no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor has first
knowledge of the adverse reactions. For fatal or life-threatening cases, the term will be a
maximum of 7 calendar days for a preliminary report with another 8 days for completion of
the final report. The investigator is encouraged to discuss with the medical monitor any
adverse experiences for which the issue of reportability is unclear or questioned.
11.4.1.13.
Handling of Overdoses and Toxicity
No information on treatment of overdose of trilaciclib is currently available. General
supportive measures should be used as appropriate.
11.4.1.14.
Reporting of Pregnancies
Pregnancy per se is not considered an AE unless there is cause to believe that the
investigational drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive
medication. Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newborn should not be
considered a SAE.
Each pregnancy in a study patient or partner of a study patient must be reported to the
sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. If a patient becomes pregnant, study
drug administration must be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy should be followed up
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth,
and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or
newborn complications. Follow-up and documentation must occur even if the patient
withdraws from the study or the study is completed.
No information is currently available regarding the effects of trilaciclib on fertility, gestation,
or subsequent child development.
Atezolizumab can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Animal studies
have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to increased risk of
immune-related rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death.
The avoidance of pregnancy or fathering a child (including sperm donation) is suggested for
6 months following the discontinuation of study drug.
11.4.2.
Clinical Laboratory Assessments
Blood samples will be collected for clinical laboratory assessments as outlined in Table 9-1.
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed:
•
Hematology (hemoglobin, WBCs with differential and platelet counts)

•
Chemistry (albumin, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], total bilirubin, calcium, chloride,
creatinine, glucose, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, total protein, ALT, AST, LDH,
amylase, lipase, sodium, and BUN)
•
TSH, free T4, and free T3
•
Urinalysis (semiquantitative dipstick: specific gravity, pH, evaluation of glucose, protein,
bilirubin, ketones, leukocytes, and hemoglobin; and a microscopic examination,
including RBC, WBC, and casts will be performed, if necessary)
If the subsequent cycle is delayed, the patient should still complete the clinical laboratory
assessments on the scheduled Day 1, as well as on the actual first dosing day of the next
cycle.
Laboratory parameters will be analyzed by a local certified laboratory and a report of the
laboratory values will be sent to the study center. Laboratory parameters for which clinically
significant values are noted will be re-measured on the appropriate clinical follow-up
arranged by the investigator. Any laboratory value that remains abnormal at the end of the
study and that is considered clinically significant will be followed according to accepted
medical standards for up to 30 days or until resolution of the abnormality, or it is deemed that
recovery is not feasible.
Laboratory toxicities will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03 (see Appendix 5).
The DMC may recommend decreasing the frequency of hematological evaluations based on
accumulating data. The investigators and IRBs or IECs will be notified if the frequency is
reduced.
11.4.3.
Demographics and Vital Signs
The following will be collected:
•
Height in centimeters (cm)
•
Body weight in kilogram (kg)
•
Body temperature (Celsius)
•
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and pulse oximetry will
be measured with the patient. Blood pressure should be assessed after 5 minutes of rest.
11.4.4.
Physical Examination
Full physical examination evaluations at screening should include general appearance, skin,
neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and
neurological examinations. Subsequent physical exams should include body systems as
appropriate.
Information about the physical examination must be present in the source documentation at
the study site. The result of the physical examination prior to the start of study drug must be
included in the relevant eCRF. Clinically relevant findings made after the start of study drug,
which meet the definition of an AE, must be recorded on the AE eCRF.

11.4.5.
Electrocardiogram Assessments
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed as outlined in Table 9-1. Patients should rest for
5 minutes prior to each ECG assessment.
Any ECG with a QTc value of > 500 should be repeated every 5 minutes for a total of
3 ECGs to confirm this finding. The QTc value should also be confirmed via manual read.
The investigator or qualified designee should review the ECGs for any abnormalities as
compared with predose ECGs.
11.4.6.
Concomitant Medications
Review of concomitant medications will occur at the times outlined in Table 9-1. See
Section 8.6 for more information on concomitant medications.
11.5.
Patient Reported Outcomes
The FACT-L and FACT-An instruments will be administered to the patients by a designated
trained study site staff member. The instruments will be administered in the clinic for the
baseline assessment (on or within 1 day prior to initiation of study treatment), at Day 1 of
each cycle, and at the Post-Treatment visit. If the subsequent cycle is delayed, the patient
should still complete the PRO on the scheduled Day 1, as well as on the actual first dosing
day of the next cycle. Where possible, the same staff member will administer the instrument
at each site.
Both the FACT-L and FACT-An contain a core general questionnaire that measures physical,
social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. The FACT-L has an additional lung
cancer subscale (FACT-L) (Cella 1995). The FACT-An has an additional subscale that
measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patients with cancer
(FACT-An) (Yellen 1997). The core general questionnaire is the same for both instruments;
as such, at each assessment, the core questionnaire will be administered once along with the
lung and anemia subscales.
11.6.
Immunologic Markers
The addition of trilaciclib to standard chemotherapy could provide clinical benefit to patients
with CDK4/6-independent cancers through the reduction of myelosuppression-related side
effects and improved chemotherapy activity. There are at least 2 potential mechanisms by
which trilaciclib may improve chemotherapy activity: maintaining dose intensity and
maintaining immune system function through repeated cycles of chemotherapy. In addition
to the common side effects that result from myelosuppression, chemotherapy-induced
immunosuppression may limit response rates and survival due to an inability of the damaged
host immune system to effectively mount a response against the cancer. The impact of
chemotherapy on the host immune system has been shown to be a double-edged sword,
where the specific chemotherapeutic agent and dosing regimen (low dose versus standard
dosing) dictate the impact on the immune system. Chemotherapeutic agents may elicit part of
their antitumor efficacy by modulating the immune system to enhance antigen presentation,
uptake, and processing; prime the immune response through immunodepletion; inhibit

regulatory cells; and stimulate immune effector cells (Zitvogel 2008; McDonnell 2011;
Bracci 2014). Conversely, immunosuppression from direct cytotoxicity to the bone marrow
and immune system over repeated cycles of chemotherapy may counterbalance the positive
immunostimulatory effects of chemotherapy. Preclinical mouse models have shown that
chemotherapeutic response is more robust in tumors transplanted into immunocompetent
mice compared to immunodeficient mice, suggesting that the loss of immune system function
is detrimental to the overall efficacy of the chemotherapy (Apetoh 2007; Casares 2005). In
support of these data, severe lymphopenia (< 1000 cells/µL) in patients with breast cancer,
advanced soft tissue sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been shown to negatively
affect PFS and OS (Ray-Coquard 2009).
Since immune reprogramming is now believed to be an important mechanism of
chemotherapy response, therapeutic approaches to maintain bone marrow health and immune
system function should enhance this activity. The effect of trilaciclib in combination with
chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor was evaluated in MC38 tumor-bearing mice treated
with trilaciclib, oxaliplatin, or anti-PD-L1 alone or in combination. Tumor size was measured
during and post treatment for 100 days. The addition of trilaciclib to an oxaliplatin/
anti-PD-L1 combination (TOP) treatment significantly improved the overall response rate,
complete response rate, and median OS compared to oxaliplatin/anti-PD-L1 combination
(93% vs 46%; 79% vs 38%; not reached at 100 days vs 59 days, respectively). Taken
together, this demonstrates that trilaciclib, which has been shown to preserve immune
function during chemotherapy, enhances the antitumor activity of chemotherapy/anti-PD-L1
combination therapy.
Therefore, to evaluate the impact of trilaciclib administration on chemotherapy-induced
changes of the immune system, peripheral blood immune subsets will be characterized in
patients enrolled into the study. Immunophenotypic changes will be compared between
patients receiving E/P/A therapy plus placebo or trilaciclib. To assess these changes,
peripheral blood will be collected at predose on Day 1 of Induction Cycle 1, Day 1 of
Maintenance Cycle 1 (first cycle of maintenance part), Day 1 of Maintenance Cycle 5, and at
the post-treatment visit at 90 (+7) days after the last dose of study drug.
11.7.
Appropriateness of Measurements
The measures of efficacy, PK, and safety evaluated in this study are based on the mechanism
and activity of trilaciclib, standard types of assessments typically performed in patients with
SCLC, and prior clinical observations derived from patients receiving trilaciclib + E/P/A
therapy. The measurement of tumor response based on the RECIST v1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009)
is standard. The PK and safety measures included in this study are also standard.

STUDY TERMINATION OR STUDY DRUG
DISCONTINUATION
12.1.
Study Termination
The entire study may be terminated in the event of any of the following:
•
Occurrence of AEs unknown to date with respect of their nature, severity, and duration,
or the unexpected incidence of known AEs
•
Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study
•
Difficulties in the recruitment of patients
•
Cancellation of the drug development program
•
Sponsor decision for other reasons
12.2.
Site Termination
A study site will be closed if there is evidence of fraud, other unethical conduct, or
significant regulatory noncompliance to the protocol or to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), or
if insufficient patients have been enrolled to meet the site objectives.
12.3.
Discontinuation of Study Drug
Study drug will be discontinued if any of the following events occur during the study:
•
A patient suffers an AE that, in the judgment of the investigator, sponsor, or medical
monitor, presents an unacceptable risk to the patient (see Section 8.4.5)
•
General or specific changes in the patient’s condition (eg, a significant intercurrent illness
or complication) that, in the judgment of the investigator, are unacceptable for further
administration of study drug
•
Occurrence of pregnancy
•
Significant noncompliance with protocol requirements
•
The sponsor or legal representative of the sponsor requests the patient to withdraw
•
Patient has radiologically documented disease progression and the physician determines
the patient is not deriving clinical benefit as defined in Section 11.1.4.
Discontinuation or interruption of trilaciclib or placebo + E/P does not preclude continuation
of atezolizumab and vice versa. For instance, if an AE is attributed to trilaciclib or placebo,
etoposide, or carboplatin (eg, hematologic toxicity) during the induction part; then
atezolizumab will be continued while the trilaciclib or placebo + E/P are held. While the
trilaciclib or placebo + E/P are held, the patient will continue to receive atezolizumab, be
monitored for safety, and will begin the next trilaciclib or placebo + E/P/A-containing
induction cycle after the toxicity resolves. If the AE is immune related and attributed to
atezolizumab; then trilaciclib or placebo + E/P will be continued for up to 4 cycles while the
atezolizumab is held.

After discontinuation of all study drugs, patients should be strongly encouraged to complete
all scheduled assessments through the end of their current 21-day treatment cycle,
CBC assessment on Day 22; all Post-Treatment Visits; and the Survival
Follow-up Phase of the study. A patient who discontinues study treatment for reasons other
than progressive disease will have a CT or MRI scan every 2 months (approximately
60 ± 7 days) until the occurrence of progressive disease or study completion.
The investigator will document the reason for study drug discontinuation on the applicable
eCRF page.
When discontinuation is due to a SAE or a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity considered to be related to
study medication, the investigator should follow the event until resolution, return to baseline,
or it is deemed that further recovery is unlikely. Data on these events should be collected on
the AE CRF.
In the event a patient discontinues due to an AE or pregnancy, the investigator should notify
the medical monitor by telephone within 48 hours of study drug discontinuation.

Withdrawal of Patients from the Study
Patients may withdraw from the study at their own discretion (or at the discretion of the
investigator) for any reason at any time. The following list of reasons for withdrawing
patients from the study may include but are not limited to:
•
Withdrawal of informed consent
•
Lost to follow-up (must have at least 2 documented attempts to contact the patient;
1 attempt must be written to the patient and sent via certified letter)
All data collected prior to the date of withdrawal of consent will remain in the clinical

STATISTICS
Full details on the statistical analyses to be performed will be provided in separate statistical
analysis plans (SAPs); due to discrepancies between regional regulatory requirements, details
of the analyses will be specific to the endpoints in each region and will be defined in detail in
the respective regional SAP prior to unblinding. Hence, details of the methods are not fully
described in this protocol. For any differences in analyses between the protocol and SAP, the
plan as outlined in the SAP will supersede the protocol.
While this Study G1T28-05 was originally designed to evaluate OS as the primary efficacy
endpoint comparing trilaciclib + E/P/A to placebo + E/P/A, recent clinical results from Study
G1T28-02 in patients with treatment-naive extensive-stage SCLC comparing trilaciclib plus
E/P to placebo + E/P, provided compelling evidence that trilaciclib decreased
myelosuppression across 3 lineages: neutrophils, RBC, and lymphocytes and achieved a
meaningful level of myelopreservation. Critical hematologic myelosuppression endpoints
were identified from that study and will be applied across the trilaciclib program. Hence,
Study G1T28-05, where the chemotherapy backbone of etoposide and carboplatin and the
patient population is the same as Study G1T28-02, is being modified to broaden the analysis
of trilaciclib benefit to include multiple primary and key secondary endpoints related to
myelosuppression, while retaining OS as a secondary endpoint. This amendment changes the
primary endpoint of Study G1T28-05 from OS to primary and key secondary endpoints
measuring clinically meaningful reductions in myelosuppression. This revision does not alter
the ability of G1T28-05 to fulfill its original goal, but rather these changes facilitate the
sponsor’s ability to confirm the benefit of trilaciclib for treatment of myelosuppression in a
second randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in first line SCLC. The same
myelopreservation mechanism of action (MOA) of trilaciclib that is associated with
improvement in myelosuppression is also hypothesized to potentially impact antitumor
efficacy, such as OS. Therefore, changing the primary endpoint to myelosuppression allows
for an earlier assessment of trilaciclib MOA and efficacy, with OS retained as a later
manifestation of its effect. Although the primary endpoint for the G1T28-05 protocol was
designed to be OS, the data collection for the myelosuppression analyses has been consistent
with the data collection in the other trilaciclib clinical studies evaluating myelosuppression as
a primary endpoint. As such, the data for this revised primary analysis has been collected
throughout the study. This change in endpoints also does not alter the assessments or
protocol-defined patient care.
At the time of performing the primary and secondary myelosuppression analyses, all patients
will have completed the randomized induction treatment part of the study and will have
discontinued trilaciclib or placebo. However, patients may still be in the atezolizumab
monotherapy maintenance part of the study or being followed for survival. This will ensure
that this amendment will not incur any potential operational bias for the PFS/OS analysis
results.
13.1.
Sample Size and Power
The initial sample size calculations were based on a primary endpoint of OS where a sample
size of 100 (1:1 treatment allocation ratio between the two groups of placebo + E/P/A and
G1 Therapeutics
Clinical Study Protocol G1T28-05

G1 Therapeutics CONFIDENTIAL
trilaciclib + E/P/A) provided 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6 using an overall type
1 error probability of 0.1 (1-sided). With the change in endpoints outlined in this
amendment, the sample size calculation is now based on demonstrating the superiority of
trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A with respect to at least one of the primary
endpoints.
With this amendment, the overall type I error rate is now 0.025 (1-sided) and the type II error
rate used to compute sample size is 0.10 (corresponding to 90% power).
To maintain the overall type I error rate, by using the most conservative Bonferroni
procedure for the 2 primary endpoints, a 1-sided individualized type I error rate 0.025/2 =
0.0125 is assigned to each outcome variable in the sample size calculation. Assuming a
common standard deviation (StD) of 2.5, a true difference in the duration of severe (Grade 4)
neutropenia in Cycle 1 of at least 2 days between the treatment groups (trilaciclib + E/P/A
versus placebo + E/P/A) requires, 82 evaluable patients (41 per treatment arm). This implies
that 88 patients need to be randomized assuming a 95% evaluability rate. For occurrence
endpoints (occurrence of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia, assuming its proportion of 45% for
placebo + E/P/A, testing for an absolute reduction of 34% to 11% with trilaciclib + E/P/A
would require a sample size of at least 100 patients (50 per treatment arm). Assuming a 95%
evaluability rate, at least 106 patients need to be enrolled to complete the study. Therefore,
the final adjusted sample size is 106 to account for the evaluation of 2 primary endpoints.
All calculations were carried out using the POWER procedure in SAS® version 9.4.
13.2.
General Considerations
13.2.1.
Analysis Sets
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized patients. Analyses using the
ITT will be conducted on the basis of the assigned treatment. All efficacy analyses will be
assessed using the ITT and the ITT is the primary analysis set for analysis. A modified ITT
(mITT) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set and will only include the ITT patients
who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Supportive sensitivity analyses will be conducted
based on the mITT analysis set for primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints to evaluate
the robustness of the results. Analyses using the mITT will be conducted on the basis of the
assigned treatment.
The safety analysis set includes all enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of study
drug. The safety analysis set analyses will be conducted on the basis of the actual treatment
received. All safety analyses will be assessed using the safety analysis set.
A per-protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the mITT analysis set and may also be used to
analyze select endpoints; it will be based on study drug exposure (compliance and/or time on
study drug) and major protocol deviations, which will be fully defined and documented
before unblinding. The criteria for inclusion in the PP analysis set will be finalized and
documented prior to unblinding patients in the study.

The response evaluable analysis set will include all patients who are in the mITT and have at
least 1 postbaseline tumor assessment, or have clinical progression as noted by the
investigator before their first postbaseline tumor scan or have died due to disease progression
before their first postbaseline tumor scan. The response evaluable analysis set will be used
for analyses of tumor response.
The PK set will include all dosed patients in Part 1 with evaluable PK data.
13.2.2.
Timing of Analyses
13.2.2.1.
DMC Reviews
A DMC will monitor accumulating safety data according to a charter that defines its roles
and responsibilities. The DMC will perform reviews after approximately 12 patients have
been enrolled and have completed at least 1 cycle to assess the initial safety data from the
2 groups, and then approximately every 4 months during the Treatment Phase, depending
upon the enrollment rate. Additional reviews may occur based on DMC requests. The
committee will consist of individuals with extensive multicenter clinical study experience
drawn from the fields of clinical oncology (specifically, SCLC) and biostatistics. These
individuals will be entirely independent of the conduct of the study.
Additional details regarding the committee procedures and policies, including table displays
and strategy for maintaining study blind, are described in the DMC charter.
13.2.2.2.
Final Analysis
The final analysis will be conducted after all patients have had the opportunity to receive at
least 12 weeks of treatment (ie, randomized induction treatment part of the study). All study
data collected through the time of the final analysis data cut, will be included in the final
analysis. This includes, but is not limited to, the final myelosuppression analysis, final ORR
analysis, and interim PFS/OS analyses.
At the time of the final analysis, the sponsor will be unblinded; however, investigators and
patients will remain blinded.
13.2.2.3.
End of Study Analysis
Patients will be followed for survival until at least 70% of the patients have died at which
time an end of study analysis for OS and PFS will be done. Reported results, with the
exception of the myelosuppression analyses, will be cumulative in nature, including all data
collected during the entire study; the myelosuppression analyses will be complete at the final
analysis and no additional data will be expected. Additional PFS/OS analyses may be done
with the timing to occur between the first interim PFS/OS efficacy analysis and the end of
study PFS/OS analysis.

Efficacy Analyses
Unless otherwise specified, all the myelosuppression efficacy analyses will be based on the
ITT. Unless otherwise specified, all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be
evaluated and derived for the induction treatment period between the date of randomization
and the end of the last cycle in the protocol-defined induction phase (ie, last cycle of placebo
or trilaciclib plus E/P/A).

Primary Myelosuppression Efficacy Endpoints
The primary myelosuppression efficacy endpoints are defined as follows:
All Regions
Duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia in Cycle 1
Occurrence of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia
13.5.1.1.
Methods of Analysis for Primary Myelosuppression Efficacy Endpoints
A 2-sided p-value will be calculated for the DSN in Cycle 1 using nonparametric analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) (Stokes 2012). The nonparametric ANCOVA will include study
baseline ANC value as covariate, stratification factors of ECOG performance status (0 to 1
versus 2) and presence of brain metastases (yes versus no), and treatment as a fixed effect.
Along with the descriptive statistics, the Hodges-Lehmann estimate of median difference
between the 2 treatment groups, together with its 95% CIs will be provided.
The occurrence of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia is a binary response variable (yes versus no)
and will be analysed to compare trilaciclib and placebo using modified Poisson regression
(Zou 2004) to account for the variable duration of the induction treatment period for each
patient. The model will include baseline value as covariate, the stratification factors of
ECOG performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) and presence of brain metastases (yes versus no),
and treatment as a fixed effect. The 1-sided p-value adjusted relative risk (aRR) (trilaciclib vs
placebo) and its 95% CIs will be presented.
A detailed description of the analysis methods will be provided in the SAPs.
13.5.2.
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The key secondary efficacy endpoints are defined in the table below.

13.5.2.1.
Methods of Analysis for OS
Although OS is a key secondary endpoint in Region 2, OS will be analyzed with a
descriptive intention and will not be factored into multiplicity adjustment as described in
Section 13.5.3. That is, no formal statistical testing will be planned. The analysis of OS will
be primarily aimed at showing lack of harm from trilaciclib.
OS will be calculated as the time (months) from the date of randomization to the date of
death due to any cause. Patients who do not die during the study will be censored at the date
last known to be alive. Patients lacking data beyond the date of randomization will have their
survival time censored at the date of randomization. OS will not be censored if a patient
receives subsequent anticancer treatments after discontinuation of the study drugs.
13.5.2.2.
Methods of Analysis for Key Secondary Myelosuppression Endpoints
A binary response variable (yes versus no) for the key secondary endpoints will be analyzed
to compare trilaciclib and placebo using modified Poisson regression (Zou 2004) as outlined
in Section 13.5.1.1.
The total number of MAHE will be analyzed to compare trilaciclib and placebo using a
negative binomial regression model to account for the variable duration of the induction
treatment period for each patient. The model includes stratification factors of ECOG
performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) and presence of brain metastases (yes versus no), and
treatment as a fixed effect. The 1-sided p-value adjusted relative risk (aRR) (trilaciclib vs
placebo) and its 95% CIs will be presented. The cumulative incidence of events will be
presented graphically.
A more detailed description of the analysis methods will be provided in the SAPs.
13.5.3.
Multiplicity Adjustment for the Primary and Key Secondary
Myelosuppression Efficacy Endpoints
To accommodate the primary and key secondary myelosuppression efficacy endpoints, a
Hochberg-based gatekeeping procedure will be utilized to control the global familywise
error rate across the multiple null hypotheses in the strong sense at a 1-sided α=0.025
level. The one-sided p-values for these comparisons will be used for the multiple test
procedure. The general testing strategy is described below for Region 1 (Section
13.5.3.1) and Region 2 (Section 13.5.3.2) with more detailed information provided in the
respective SAPs.
13.5.3.1.
Multiplicity Adjustments in Region 1
The multiplicity problem includes the following 10 hypotheses of no effect:
•
Hypothesis H1. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia in Cycle 1.
•
Hypothesis H2. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
occurrence of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia.

•
Hypothesis H3. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
occurrence of RBC transfusions on/after Week 5 on study.
•
Hypothesis H4. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
occurrence of G-CSF administration.
•
Hypothesis H5. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for the
MAHE composite.
•
Hypothesis H6. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
all-cause hospitalizations in the MAHE composite.
•
Hypothesis H7. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
all-cause dose reductions in the MAHE composite.
•
Hypothesis H8. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
febrile neutropenia in the MAHE composite.
•
Hypothesis H9. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
RBC transfusions on/after Week 5 in the MAHE composite.
•
Hypothesis H10. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
prolonged severe (Grade 4) neutropenia (> 5 days) in the MAHE composite.
These 10 hypotheses can be grouped into 3 families:
•
Family 1 (F1) includes the hypotheses H1 and H2.
•
Family 2 (F2) includes the hypothesis H3, H4, and H5.
•
Family 3 (F3) includes the hypotheses H6, H7, H8, H9, and H10.
The 1-sided p-values for these 10 comparisons will be used for the multiple testing
procedure.
A Hochberg-based gatekeeping procedure will be utilized to control the global familywise
error rate across the 10 null hypotheses in the strong sense at a 1-sided α=0.025 level, and it
satisfies the positive dependence condition at the 1-sided setting. The procedure is built using
the mixture methodology developed in Dmitrienko and Tamhane (2011) and accounts for the
logical restrictions among the 10 hypotheses displayed in Figure 13-1 by performing
multiplicity adjustments in three steps:
•
Step 1. The trilaciclib vs placebo comparisons for Family 1 (hypotheses H1 and H2)
are performed using a truncated version of the Hochberg procedure. The truncation
parameter γ is set to 0.5.
•
Step 2. The trilaciclib vs placebo comparisons for Family 2 (hypotheses H3, H4, and
H5) are performed using a truncated version of the Hochberg procedure if there is at
least one significance in Step 1. Specifically, the hypotheses H3, H4, and H5 depend
on the hypotheses H1 and H2, ie, H3, H4, and H5 are tested only if at least one of the
hypotheses H1 and H2 is rejected. The truncation parameter γ is set to 0.5.

•
Step 3. The trilaciclib vs placebo comparisons for Family 3 (hypotheses H6, H7, H8,
H9, and H10) are performed using the regular Hochberg test if H5 is significant in
Step 2.
Figure 13-1
Graphical Display of the Hochberg-based Gatekeeping Procedure for
Region 1
The regular Hochberg test is defined in Dmitrienko et al. (2009) and the truncated Hochberg
test is defined in Dmitrienko, Tamhane and Wiens (2008). The decision rules used in the
regular and truncated Hochberg tests will be detailed in the SAPs. In general terms, the
truncated version of the Hochberg test is defined as a convex combination of the regular
Hochberg and Bonferroni tests. An important parameter of the truncated Hochberg test is the
truncation parameter γ which ranges between 0 and 1. If the truncation parameter γ is set to
0, the truncated Hochberg test simplifies to the Bonferroni test. On the other hand, if the
truncation parameter γ is set to 1, the truncated Hochberg test is identical to the regular
Hochberg test. The truncated Hochberg test satisfies the separability condition (Dmitrienko,
Tamhane and Wiens, 2008) if the truncation parameter γ is strictly less than 1. This condition
ensures that in each step of the testing algorithm the error rate can be transferred to the next
step provided at least one trilaciclib vs placebo comparison is significant in the current step
without inflating the overall type I error rate (Huque, 2016; FDA, 2017).
13.5.3.2.
Multiplicity Adjustments in Region 2
The multiplicity problem includes the following 5 hypotheses of no effect:
•
Hypothesis H1. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia in Cycle 1.
•
Hypothesis H2. Comparison of trilaciclib + E/P/A versus placebo + E/P/A for
occurrence of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia.

occurrence of RBC transfusions on/after Week 5 on study.

occurrence of G-CSF administration.
These 5 hypotheses can be grouped into 3 families:

Family 2 (F2) includes the hypothesis H2.
•
Family 3 (F3) includes the hypotheses H3, H4, and H5.
Figure 13-2
Graphical Display of the Hochberg-based Gatekeeping Procedure for
Region 2
Though the testing procedure can be broadly considered as a fixed sequence procedure with
the third family consisting of three hypotheses H3, H4, and H5, its implementation can be
performed through a similar Hochberg-based gatekeeping procedure as described in
Section 13.5.3.1. Hence, the multiplicity adjustments will be performed in three steps as
demonstrated in Figure 13-2:
•
Step 1. The trilaciclib vs placebo comparisons for Family 1 (hypothesis H1) is
performed using a truncated version of the Hochberg procedure. The truncation
parameter γ is set to 0.
•
Step 2. The trilaciclib vs placebo comparisons for Family 2 (hypothesis H2) is
performed using a truncated version of the Hochberg procedure if H1 is significant in
Step 1. The truncation parameter γ is set to 0.

Step 3. The trilaciclib vs placebo comparisons for Family 3 (hypotheses H3, H4, and
H5) are performed using the regular Hochberg test if H2 is significant in Step 2.
Based on the proposed testing strategy in Figure 13-2, the study can be potentially claimed to
be positive if at least both H1 and H2 are statistically significant.

Analysis of Supportive Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Antitumor and
Myelosuppression)
The detailed derivation for these endpoints along with their analysis methods will be
included in the SAPs.
For Region 1 only, OS will be considered as a supportive secondary endpoint and will be
analyzed according to Section 13.5.2.1.
For Region 2 only, the composite MAHE endpoint will be considered a supportive
secondary efficacy endpoint to be analyzed as described above (Section 13.5.3).
All the remaining endpoints are relevant to both Regions.
Anti-tumor activity per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as
assessed by the investigator will include the following:
•
Objective response (CR or PR)
•
Best overall response (BOR)
•
Duration of objective response (DOR)
•
Progression-free survival (PFS)
At each tumor assessment visit, an overall time point response by RECIST v1.1 will be
determined programmatically using the information from target lesions, NTLs, and new
lesions collected in the eCRF. BOR will be determined using visit responses until the last
evaluable overall visit response prior to or on the date of (i) radiographic disease progression;
(ii) withdrawal of consent to obtain scans; (iii) death; (iv) lost to follow-up; or (v) initiation
of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
Duration of Objective Response (DOR) is the time between first objective response of CR or
PR and the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented or death, whichever
comes first. Patients who do not experience objective CR or PR will not be included in the
analysis. For patients with objective response of CR or PR but (i) withdrawal of consent to
obtain scans; (ii) lost to follow up; (iii) initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, or (iv)
death, the DOR of this patient will be censored at the earliest date among these four.
PFS is defined as the time (number of months) from date of randomization until date of
documented radiologic disease progression per RECIST version 1.1 or death due to any
cause, whichever comes first. More specifically, PFS will be determined using all data until
the last evaluable visit prior to or on the date of (i) radiographic disease progression per
RECIST version 1.1; (ii) withdrawal of consent to obtain scans; or (iii) initiation of

QUALITY CONTROLAND QUALITY ASSURANCE
An eCRF must be completed for each patient enrolled. Each completed eCRF, as well as
records for those patients who discontinue the study, will require a signature by the principal
investigator at the study site. If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted
on the eCRF, and if a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment-limiting
AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. The investigator
should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported to
the sponsor in the eCRFs and in all required reports.
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross-check of the
eCRFs against the investigator’s records by the study monitor (source document
verification), and the maintenance of a drug-dispensing log by the investigator.
A comprehensive validation check program will verify the data and discrepancy reports will
be generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator. As patients complete the study
(or withdraw) and their signed eCRFs become available for review, a comparison check will
be run to identify and resolve any discrepancies in the data base.

DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING
16.1.
Data Collection and Retrieval
This study will use a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant electronic data capture system. An eCRF will
be used for data recording. All data requested on the eCRF must be entered and all missing
data must be accounted for.
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross-check of the
eCRF against the investigator’s records by the study monitor (source document verification),
and the maintenance of a study drug-dispensing log by the investigator.
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a sponsor
representative will review the protocol and eCRFs with the investigators and their staff.
During the study, a monitor will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient
records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, and
the progress of enrollment. The monitor will ensure during on-site visits that study
medication is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key
study personnel must be available to assist the monitors during these visits.
The investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospital or clinical records to
confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries. No information in these records about the
identity of the patients will leave the study center. Monitoring standards require full
verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion
criteria, documentation of SAEs, and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables.
Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are to be performed
according to the study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2.
Data Monitoring Committee
An external DMC will be used to evaluate safety of the study in an ongoing manner (see
Section 13.2.2 for further details).
16.3.
Investigator Reporting Requirements
Local regulations may require the investigator to provide periodic safety updates on the
conduct of the study and to notify the IRB/IEC of study closure. Such updates and
notifications are the responsibility of the investigator.
16.4.
Records Retention
After closure of the study, the investigator will maintain copies of all study records (ie,
investigator files and patient files) in a secure location. The investigator’s study file will
contain the protocol, protocol amendments, eCRF and query forms, IRB/IEC, and
governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff
curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and
correspondence.

These documents must be kept on file by the investigator for a period of 2 years following
the date the marketing application is approved for the drug indication for which it is being
investigated. If no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such
indication, all records pertaining to the conduct of the clinical study must be adequately
maintained until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the regulatory authorities
are notified. After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local
regulations.
The investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without receiving
approval from the sponsor. The investigator must notify the sponsor in the event of
accidental loss or destruction of any study records and should notify the sponsor of any
reassignment of study records to another party or move to another location.
16.5.
Study Monitoring
Qualified representatives of the sponsor or sponsor designees (study monitors) will monitor
the study according to a predetermined monitoring plan. The investigator must permit the
study monitors to periodically review all eCRFs and source documents supporting the
participation of each patient in the study. The eCRFs and other documentation supporting the
study must be kept up to date by the investigator and the staff at the study site. These study
materials must be available for review by the study monitor, and/or other qualified
representatives of the sponsor, at each monitoring visit and must be provided in a way such
that the patient’s confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local institution, state,
country, and federal requirements.
16.6.
Audits and Inspections
At some point during the study or after the study, appropriately qualified personnel from the
sponsor’s Quality Assurance group, or their authorized representative, or a representative
from a regulatory authority may visit the investigator to conduct an inspection of the study
and the site. During this audit, the investigator agrees to give the auditor direct access to all
relevant documents supporting the eCRFs and other study-related documents and to discuss
any findings with the auditor. In the event of an inspection by a regulatory agency, the
investigator agrees to give the inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to discuss
any findings with the inspector.
