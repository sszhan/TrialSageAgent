Study Design and
Methodology:
This is a 3-part Phase 3 study, comprising Part A, Part B, and Part C
(Figure 1). Participants in Part A, the Blinded Phase of this study,
were blinded to their treatment assignment. Given that the primary
efficacy endpoint for mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 was met per
the protocol-defined interim analysis (IA), Part B, the Open-Label
Observational Phase of this study, was designed to offer participants
who received placebo in Part A of this study an option to request
open-label mRNA-1273 while investigational vaccine was still
available. With regard to eligibility for Part B, the US Centers for
Disease Control (CDC)-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)
guidance specifications will supersede eligibility criteria in the
protocol. Part C is designed to offer eligible participants in Part B the
option to request a BD of mRNA-1273. With regard to eligibility for
Part C, the CDC-EUA guidance specifications will supersede
eligibility criteria in the protocol.

Part A, the Blinded Phase:
The Blinded Phase of this study (Figure 1) is a randomized, stratified,
observer-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the efficacy, safety,
and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
compared to placebo in adults 18 years of age and older who have no
known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose locations or
circumstances put them at appreciable risk of acquiring COVID-19
and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive injections of either
100 µg of mRNA-1273 vaccine or a placebo control in a
1:1 randomization ratio. Assignment will be stratified by age and
health risk. This is a case-driven study and thus final sample size of
the study will depend on the actual attack rate of COVID-19.
All participants will be assessed for efficacy and safety endpoints and
provide a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sample and blood sample before
the first and second dose of IP, in addition to a series of post-dose
blood samples for immunogenicity through 24 months after the
second dose of IP. Efficacy assessments will include surveillance for
COVID-19 with RT-PCR confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection
after the first and second dose of IP.
As noted above, this is a case-driven study: if the prespecified criteria
for early efficacy are met at the time of either IA or overall efficacy
at the primary analysis, a final study report describing the efficacy
and safety of mRNA-1273 will be prepared based on the data
available at that time. In the event that success criteria are met either
at the time of the IA or when the total number of cases toward the
primary endpoint have accrued, participants will continue to be
followed in a blinded fashion until Month 25 to enable assessment of
long-term safety and durability of VE.
If the study concludes early, all participants will be requested to
provide a final blood sample at the time of study conclusion.
Each participant will receive 2 doses of IP by 0.5 mL intramuscular
(IM) injection, the first on Day 1 and the second on Day 29. An NP
swab sample will be collected prior to the first and second dose of IP,
for evaluation by RT-PCR. Participants will be given an electronic
diary (eDiary) to report solicited adverse reactions (ARs) for 7 days
after each dose of IP and to prompt an unscheduled clinic visit for
clinical evaluation and NP swab sample if a participant experiences
any symptoms of COVID-19 (throughout study). All participants will
receive safety calls on Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 36, and Day 43

that will serve both to monitor for unsolicited adverse events (AEs)
and to monitor for symptoms of COVID-19.
Surveillance for COVID-19 will be performed through weekly
contacts with the participant via a combination of telephone calls and
completion of an eDiary starting at Day 1 through the end of the
study.
Participants with symptoms of COVID-19 lasting at least 48 hours
(except for fever and/or respiratory symptoms) will return to the
clinic or will be visited at home by medically qualified site staff
within 72 hours (an “Illness Visit”) to collect an NP swab sample for
RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens, or
alternatively, if a clinic or home visit is not possible, will submit a
saliva sample for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. Any confirmed
COVID-19 occurring in a participant will be captured as a medically
attended AE (MAAE) along with relevant concomitant medications
and details about severity, seriousness, and outcome. All confirmed
serious COVID-19 cases will be reported to the Sponsor or designee
within 24 hours.
Starting with the Illness Visit, study participants will be monitored by
the study investigator (or appropriately delegated study staff) for a
14-day period (from the Illness Visit or initial COVID-19 contact) or
until symptoms resolve, whichever is later, and which may include
symptoms persisting longer than the 28-day Convalescent Period.
Each participant diagnosed with COVID-19 will monitor their body
temperature, oxygen saturation, and symptoms following the
diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition to daily follow-up of symptoms,
assessments will include the collection of saliva samples during the
28-day period following the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
investigator will determine if medical attention is required due to
worsening of COVID-19. Finally, a Convalescent Visit will be
scheduled approximately 28 days after the initial Illness Visit. At this
visit, a saliva sample will be collected, and a blood sample will be
drawn for immunologic assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The 28-day period following the Illness Visit is referred to as the
Convalescent Period. If during the Convalescent Period the
participant has a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 from the Illness
Visit, the participant will continue the Convalescent Period. If the
participant has a negative result for SARS-CoV-2 from the Illness
Visit, the participant will exit the Convalescent Period, including

discontinuation of daily telemedicine visits and collection of saliva
samples, and will return to their respective study schedule.
At each dosing visit, participants will be instructed (Day 1) or
reminded (Day 29) on how to document and report solicited ARs in
the eDiary provided. Solicited ARs will be assessed for 7 days after
each IP dose and unsolicited AEs will be assessed for 28 days after
each IP dose; serious AEs (SAEs), MAAEs, AEs leading to
withdrawal, will be assessed throughout the study.
Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase:
Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase of the study, is prompted
by the authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA.
Transitioning the study to Part B permits all ongoing study
participants to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria
of any COVID-19 vaccine made available under an EUA and the
option to offer all ongoing study participants who request unblinding,
an opportunity to schedule a participant decision visit (PDV) at the
study site to learn their original treatment assignment (placebo vs.
mRNA-1273 vaccine).
Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase of the study, also
provides the opportunity for eligible study participants who
previously received placebo to actively request to receive 2 doses of
mRNA-1273 vaccine (subject to investigational vaccine availability).
All study participants will receive a notification letter and will be

At the PDV, all participants will:
•
Be encouraged to remain in the ongoing study,
•
Be given the option to be unblinded as to their original group
assignment (placebo vs. mRNA-1273 vaccine),
•
Be counselled about the importance of continuing other public
health measures to limit the spread of disease including social
distancing, wearing a mask, and hand-washing,
•
Sign a revised informed consent form (ICF),
•
Provide a NP swab for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and a blood
sample for serology prior to unblinding.
The following participants will continue with the original study
Schedule of Events (SoEs) (Figure 2):
•
Participants who request to not be unblinded,
•
Participants who request to be unblinded and received
mRNA-1273, and
•
Participants who request to be unblinded and received placebo
and choose to remain on placebo.
Participants who are unblinded, received placebo, are eligible, and
request to receive mRNA-1273 (Figure 2) will have the following
clinic visits:
•
Open-label Dose 1 (OL-D1): To occur at the PDV or at a
scheduled subsequent visit.
•
Open-label Dose 2 (OL-D29): To occur 28 days after Dose 1
on OL-D1.
•
Open-label Clinic Visit (OL-D57): To occur 1 month after
Dose 2 on OL-D29.
•
In addition, participants will continue to comply with the
Original Study SoEs, as applicable.
Participants who are unblinded, received ONLY 1 dose of
mRNA-1273, are eligible, and request to receive mRNA-1273
(Figure 2) will have the following clinic visits:
•
Their second dose on OL-D1: To occur at the PDV or at a

In addition, participants will continue to comply with the
Original Study SoEs, as applicable.
All participants remain on their original SoE to complete 24 months
of follow-up after Dose 2; study participants who enter the
Supplemental/Modified Supplemental SoE as described above do so
in addition to their original SoE. Accordingly, all study participants
will complete the full study follow-up to 24 months after the second
dose of their original inoculation (mRNA-1273 or placebo), or
25 months after the first dose if the second dose is missed.
At a point when the mRNA-1273 vaccine is no longer available for
study use, any participant who schedules a PDV after this timepoint
will be unblinded (with no option to stay blinded) but will not be
offered to receive mRNA-1273 study vaccine. These participants will
have all of the same procedures performed as outlined in the SoE
table, with the exception of being offered to receive mRNA-1273
vaccine.
After the Biologics License Application database lock (on
04 May 2021), any remaining participants who had not been
unblinded were unblinded by the Moderna study team and received
their unblinding treatment assignment (placebo vs. messenger RNA
[mRNA] vaccine) via certified letter from the study site.
Part C, the Booster Dose Phase
Part C, providing a BD for all eligible participants who choose to
receive one, is prompted by the interim results of an ongoing
Moderna Phase 2a study (mRNA-1273-P201; NCT04405076), in
which participants who, 6 to 8 months prior, received 2 doses of
50 µg or 100 µg of mRNA-1273 were administered a 50 µg booster
of mRNA-1273. Results demonstrated enhanced immune responses
compared to pre-boost levels and met the noninferiority criteria
stipulated in the Food and Drug Administration Guidance on EUA
for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19. In addition, no new safety
signals emerged upon administration of the BD in
Study mRNA-1273-P201. Based on cumulative evidence, the
benefit-risk profile of a BD of mRNA-1273 is favorable, particularly
in light of increasing breakthrough disease with the emergence of
variants. With the wider availability of boosters under EUA,
providing the option for a BD to all eligible participants currently
enrolled in Part B is expected to promote retention of participants in
the ongoing study and thereby defend the scientific integrity of the

study for the planned 2-year duration of follow-up after the
completion of the primary vaccination series regimen.
Each study participant will receive a notification letter and will be
asked to schedule a BD-1 visit at their study site. Principal
Investigators should consider current local public health guidance for
administration of COVID-19 vaccines under EUA and marketing
authorization (if any) when determining the scheduling priority of
participants.
At the BD-1 visit, each participant will:
•
Be encouraged to remain in the ongoing study,
•
Sign a revised ICF that includes both updated safety
information relevant to the ongoing study and a BD, and the
option to receive a BD,
•
Be given the option to receive a BD consisting of a 50 µg
dose of mRNA-1273,
•
Be counselled about the importance of continuing other
public health measures to limit the spread of disease including
social distancing, wearing a mask, and hand-washing.
After the BD-1 visit, participants who do not receive a BD will
continue with the Part C Supplemental SoE for the BD-2 and BD-3
visits but will not have the BD-1a visit or the safety calls.
Participants who request a BD and are eligible and have no
contraindications to further dosing will have the following study site
visits and complete scheduled activities (subject to investigational
vaccine availability) according to the Part C Supplemental SoE:
•
BD-1 visit: Participants will receive a single 50 µg dose of
mRNA-1273.
•
BD-1a visit: Optional, and subject to blood sample kit
availability, Day 4, 3 days after BD on Day 1.
•
BD-2 visit: Day 29, 28 days after the BD on Day 1.
•
BD-3 visit: Day 181, 180 days after the BD on Day 1.
The investigator is responsible for conducting all assessments as
specified in the Part C Supplemental SoE, according to the schedule.
As this Supplemental SoE is intended to occur in addition to the
original SoEs being followed by all participants in Part B, there is a
possibility for study visits to overlap. If visits overlap according to

combined study procedures completed once.
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good
Clinical Practice, and all applicable regulatory requirements.
Randomization:
In Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, approximately
30,000 participants will be randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive
either mRNA-1273 100 µg or placebo. The randomization will be in
a blinded manner using a centralized interactive response technology,
in accordance with pre-generated randomization schedules.
Stratification:
Randomization in Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, will be
stratified based on age and, if they are < 65 years of age, based on the
presence or absence of risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19
based on CDC recommendation as of March 2020. There will be
3 strata for randomization: ≥65 years, < 65 years and categorized to
be at increased risk (“at risk”) for the complications of COVID-19,
and < 65 years “not at risk”. Risk will be defined based on the study
participants’ relevant past and current medical history. At least 25%
of enrolled participants, up to 50%, will be either ≥65 years of age or
< 65 years of age and “at risk” at Screening.
Participants who are < 65 years old will be categorized as at risk for
severe COVID-19 illness if they have at least 1 of the following risk
factors at Screening:
•
Chronic lung disease (eg, emphysema and chronic bronchitis,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis) or moderate
to severe asthma
•
Significant cardiac disease (eg, heart failure, coronary artery
disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and
pulmonary hypertension)
•
Severe obesity (body mass index ≥40 kg/m2)
•
Diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, or gestational)
•
Liver disease
•
Human immunodeficiency virus infection
Study
Population:
Participants (males and females 18 years of age or older at time of
consent), who are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with no known
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are a subset of the planned target
population. Additionally, potential study participants at increased risk

of complications from COVID-19 will be included, since it is
hypothesized that these participants might derive the greatest benefit
from a vaccine. Participants ≥65 years of age will be eligible for
enrollment with or without underlying medical conditions further
increasing their risk of severe COVID-19.
Study sites may be selected based on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk of
the local population. Approximately 30,000 participants will be
enrolled.
The full lists of inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the
body of the protocol.

Investigational
Product, Dosage,
and Route of
Administration:
The mRNA-1273 IP is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) dispersion of an
mRNA encoding the prefusion stabilized S protein of SARS-CoV-2
formulated in LNPs composed of 4 lipids (1 proprietary and
3 commercially available): the proprietary ionizable lipid SM-102;
cholesterol; 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (DSPC); and
1 monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-2,3-dimyristylglycerol with
polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 2000
(PEG2000-DMG). The mRNA-1273 vaccine is provided as a sterile
liquid for injection and is a white to off- white dispersion in
appearance, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer
containing 87 mg/mL sucrose and 10.7 mM sodium acetate at pH 7.5.
The placebo is 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) injection, which
meets the criteria of the United States Pharmacopeia.
In Part A and Part B, as applicable, IP will be administered as an IM
injection into the deltoid muscle on a 2-dose injection schedule on
Day 1 and Day 29. For injections administered for Part A and Part B,
each injection will have a volume of 0.5 mL and contain
mRNA-1273 100 µg or saline placebo. For Part C, each injection will
have a volume of 0.25 mL and contain mRNA-1273 50 µg.
Preferably, vaccine should be administered into the nondominant
arm. The second dose of IP should be administered in the same arm
as the first dose (Part A and Part B, as applicable).
The IP will be prepared for injection as a single 0.5 mL (Part A and
Part B) or 0.25 mL (Part C) dose for each participant per protocol, as
detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Unblinded personnel who will not
participate in any other aspect of the study during Part A, the Blinded
Phase, will perform IP accountability, dose preparation, and IP
administration. Study site personnel who were blinded during the
Blinded Phase will be unblinded at the participant level at the PDV.
Sample Size:
The sample size is driven by the total number of cases to demonstrate
VE (mRNA-1273 vs. placebo) to prevent COVID-19 in Part A.
Under the assumption of proportional hazards over time and with
1:1 randomization of mRNA-1273 and placebo, a total of
151 COVID-19 cases will provide 90% power to detect a
60% reduction in hazard rate (60% VE), rejecting the null hypothesis
H0: VE ≤30%, with 2 IAs at 35% and 70% of the target total number
of cases using a 1-sided O’Brien-Fleming boundary for efficacy and
a log-rank test statistic with a 1-sided false positive error rate of
0.025. The total number of cases pertains to the Per-protocol (PP) Set
accruing at least 14 days after the second dose. There are 2 planned

IAs in this study, which will be performed when approximately 35%
and 70% of the target total number of cases have been observed.
Approximately 30,000 participants will be randomized with the
following assumptions:
•
The target VE against COVID-19 is 60% (with
95% confidence interval [CI] lower bound ruling out 30%,
rejecting the null hypothesis H0: VE ≤30%).
•
A 6-month COVID-19 incidence rate of 0.75% in the placebo
arm.
•
An annual dropout rate of 2% (loss of evaluable participants).
•
Two IAs at 35% and 70% of total target cases across the
2 treatment groups with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries for
efficacy monitoring.
•
3-month uniform accrual.
•
Approximately 15% of participants will be excluded from the
PP population, and participants are at risk for COVID-19
starting 14 days after the second dose.
Power for Selected Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:
For the secondary objective on VE against virologically confirmed
SARS‑CoV‑2 infection or COVID‑19 regardless of symptomatology
or severity (COV-INF), the study will have ≥90% power to
demonstrate the VE is above 30% (to reject null hypothesis
VE ≤30%) at 1-sided alpha of 2.5% if the true VE to prevent
COV-INF is 60%, because every COVID-19 endpoint is necessarily
a COV-INF endpoint.
For the secondary objective on VE against severe COVID-19, the
power of demonstrating VE based on a total of 30 and 60 events
under different scenarios of true VE and VE criteria has been
calculated.

Statistical
Methods:
Statistical Hypotheses: For the primary efficacy objective, the null
hypothesis of this study is that the VE of mRNA-1273 to prevent first
occurrence of COVID-19 is ≤30% (ie, H0efficacy: VE ≤0.3).
The study will be considered to meet the primary efficacy objective if
the corresponding CI of VE rules out 30% at either one of the IAs or
at the primary analysis. In the primary analysis of VE of COVID-19,
cases will be counted starting 14 days after the second dose of IP.
Vaccine efficacy is defined as the percent reduction in the hazard of
the primary endpoint (mRNA-1273 vs. placebo). Equivalently, the
null hypothesis is:
•
H0efficacy: hazard ratio (HR) ≥0.7 (equivalently, proportional
hazards VE ≤0.3).
A stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be used to assess the
magnitude of the treatment group difference (ie, HR) between
mRNA-1273 and placebo at a 1-sided 0.025 significance level.
Analysis Populations: Analysis populations for statistical analyses
are Randomization Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), Modified
Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Set, PP Set, Immunogenicity Subset, Solicited
Safety Set, and Safety Set, as shown below:
•
Randomization Set: All participants who are randomized,
regardless of the participants’ treatment status in the study.
•
FAS: All randomized participants who received at least one dose
of IP. Participants will be analyzed according to the group to
which they were randomized.
•
mITT Set: All participants in the FAS who had no immunologic
or virologic evidence of prior COVID-19 (ie, negative NP swab
test at Day 1 and/or bAb against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
below limit of detection or lower limit of quantification [LLOQ])
at Day 1 before the first dose of IP. Participants will be analyzed
according to the group to which they were randomized.
•
PP Set: All participants in the mITT Set who received planned
doses of IP per schedule and have no major protocol deviations,
as determined and documented by Sponsor prior to database lock
and unblinding, that impact critical or key study data.
Participants will be analyzed according to the group to which
they were randomized.
•
Immunogenicity Subset: All participants in the FAS who were
sampled into subset for characterizing mRNA-1273
immunogenicity and had a valid immunogenicity test result prior

to the first dose of IP and at least 1 valid result after the first dose
of IP. Participants in the subset who had major protocol
deviations that impact critical or key immunogenicity or study
data may be excluded from the Immunogenicity Subset. The
details of the Immunogenicity Subset will be documented prior
to analysis of immunogenicity data.
•
Solicited Safety Set: The Solicited Safety Set consists of all
randomized participants who received at least one dose of IP and
contributed any solicited AR data. The Solicited Safety Set will
be used for the analyses of solicited ARs and participants will be
included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP that they
actually received.
•
Safety Set: All randomized participants who received at least
one dose of IP. The Safety Set will be used for all analyses of
safety except for the solicited ARs. Participants will be included
in the treatment group corresponding to the IP that they actually
received.
Efficacy Analyses: Efficacy analyses will be performed using the
FAS, mITT, and PP populations, and participants will be included in
the treatment group to which they were randomized. The primary
analysis population for efficacy will be the PP Set.

Safety: Safety and reactogenicity will be assessed by clinical review
of all relevant parameters. Safety analyses will be provided for
Parts A, B, and C separately unless specified otherwise.
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set, except summaries
of solicited ARs, which will be based on the Solicited Safety Set. All
safety analyses will be provided by treatment group, and by treatment
cohort as applicable, unless otherwise specified.
The number and percentage of participants with any solicited local
AR, with any solicited systemic AR, and with any solicited AR
during the 7-day follow-up period after each injection will be
provided only for Part A. A 2-sided 95% exact CI using the

provided in the Part C Safety Set (ie, participants who received
booster in Part C).
For all other safety parameters, descriptive summary statistics will be
provided.
Further details will be described in the SAP.
Immunogenicity: The secondary immunogenicity endpoints will be
analyzed using the Immunogenicity Subset by treatment group, by
treatment cohort as applicable, and by baseline SARS-CoV-2
serostatus, unless otherwise specified.
The SAP will describe the complete set of immunogenicity analyses,
including the approach to sample individuals into an Immunogenicity
Subset for characterizing vaccine immunogenicity and assessing
immunological correlates of risk and protection.
Part A
Data from quantitative immunogenicity assays will be summarized
for each treatment group using positive response rates and geometric
means with 95% CI, for each timepoint for which an assessment is
performed. Data from qualitative (ie, yielding a positive or negative
result) assays will be summarized by tabulating the frequency of
positive responses for each assay by group at each timepoint that an
assessment is performed. Analyses will focus on the 2 key
immunogenicity timepoints and the change in marker response
between them: Day 1 before the first dose of IP and Day 57 (28 days
after the second dose of IP). The SAP will describe the complete set
of immunogenicity analyses.
Quantitative levels or geometric mean titer (GMT) of specific bAb
with corresponding 95% CI at each timepoint and geometric mean
fold rise (GMFR) of specific bAb with corresponding 95% CI at each
postbaseline timepoint over pre-dose baseline at Day 1 will be
provided by study arm. Descriptive summary statistics including
median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided.
The GMT of specific nAb with corresponding 95% CI at each
timepoint and GMFR of specific nAb with corresponding 95% CI at
each post-baseline timepoint over pre-dose baseline at Day 1 will be
provided by study arm. Descriptive summary statistics including
median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided. For
summarizations of group variables values, antibody (Ab) values
reported as below the LLOQ will be replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values

that are reported as greater than the upper limit of quantification
(ULOQ) without the actual values will be converted to the ULOQ.
The number and percentage of participants with a fold rise ≥2, ≥3,
and ≥4 of serum SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb titers and participants
with seroresponse from baseline will be provided with 2-sided 95%
CI using the Clopper-Pearson method at each post-baseline
timepoint. Seroresponse at a participant level may be defined as a
change from below the LLOQ to at least 4 times the LLOQ, or at
least a 4-fold rise in nAb or vaccine antigen-specific bAb in
participants with pre-existing nAb or bAb of at least the LLOQ at
baseline/pre-vaccination. Seroresponse may also be defined for each
specific assay assessing nAb or bAb. The definition of seroresponse
will be finalized and documented in the SAP.
The GMT of specific nAb for each group and the geometric mean
ratio (GMR) of mRNA-1273 versus placebo in Part A with
corresponding 2-sided 95% CI will be estimated at each study
timepoint using an analysis of covariance model with the treatment
group and baseline values, if applicable, as explanatory variables, the
analysis may adjust for the stratification factor.
Part C
In Part C, the immunogenicity analysis of BD vaccine response will
be performed using the noninferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses
based on the 2 key secondary endpoints, respectively.
Part C Key Secondary Endpoint 1: Ab GMT at BD-Day 29
Hypothesis: immunogenicity response to mRNA-1273 BD as
measured by Ab GMT at BD-Day 29 in Part C is noninferior
compared with Ab GMT at Day 57 (28 days after the second dose) in
the primary series of mRNA-1273.
The noninferiority of post-booster GMT at BD-Day 29 in Part C as
compared to the primary series at Day 57 is considered to be
demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR (ratio of
GMT at BD-Day 29 vs. GMT at Day 57 [28 days after Dose 2 of the
primary series]) is ≥0.67 using a noninferiority margin of 1.5
(1.5-fold immuno-bridging margin for the lower bound of the 95% CI
for GMT ratio/GMR).
The GMT with 95% CI will be summarized using t-distribution of the
log transferred values and then back transformed to the original scale.

second dose) will be computed based on the t-distribution of mean
difference in the log transferred values and then back transformed to
the original scale.
Part C Key Secondary Endpoint 2: Ab Seroresponse Rate at
BD-Day 29
Hypothesis: immunogenicity response to mRNA-1273 BD as
measured by seroresponse rate (SRR) at BD-Day 29 in Part C is
noninferior compared with SRR of the primary series at Day 57
(28 days after the second dose of the primary series of mRNA-1273).
The noninferiority in SRR post-booster at BD-Day 29 in Part C
compared with SRR of the primary series at Day 57 (28 days after the
second dose of the primary series of mRNA-1273) is considered to be
demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR difference
(SRR of the booster at BD-Day 29 – SRR of the primary series at
Day 57) is > -10% (using the noninferiority margin of 10%). The
SRR difference is defined as the seroresponse rate at BD-Day 29 in
Part C minus the seroresponse rate at Day 57 (28 days after the
second dose) following the primary series of mRNA-1273. The
seroresponse of a booster or the primary series is defined as a titer
change from baseline (pre-Dose 1 in primary series) below the LLOQ
to ≥4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4-fold rise if baseline is ≥LLOQ.
The SRR with 95% CI (using Clopper-Pearson method) will be
provided. The SRR difference with 95% CI to compare post-booster
SRR at BD-Day 29 in Part C with the primary series SRR at Day 57
(28 days after the second dose) will be computed. The method for
computing 95% CI of seroresponse rate difference will be provided
in the SAP.
The primary immunogenicity objective in Part C is met if
noninferiority is demonstrated based on both key secondary
endpoints (both GMT and SRR).

INTRODUCTION
2.1.
Study Rationale
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common
cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and
severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV).
An outbreak of the CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 began in Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has spread throughout China and to over 216 other
countries and territories, including the United States (WHO 2020). On 11 Mar 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. As of 28 May 2020, the
WHO reported more than 5,593,631 confirmed cases and 353,334 deaths globally and the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 1,698,523 confirmed and probable
cases of COVID-19, with 100,446 deaths in the United States (CDC 2020a). The CDC have
reported that the highest risk of disease burden is in older adults (≥65 years old) and people of any
age who have serious underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease or moderate to
severe asthma; serious heart conditions; severe obesity; diabetes; chronic kidney disease requiring
dialysis; liver disease; and those who are immunocompromised (CDC 2020b).
At the time the present Phase 3 study was initiated, no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 had been
authorized or approved. Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to
treat severe SARS-CoV-2 infections have intensified, but no proven therapeutic currently exists.
Therefore, there is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel interventions to
prevent the spread of this disease. The primary goal of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the vaccine
efficacy (VE) of mRNA-1273 to prevent COVID-19, compared to placebo.
2.2.
Background and Overview
ModernaTX, Inc. (the Sponsor) has developed a rapid response, proprietary vaccine platform
based on a messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and
observations that cells in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it, and then express protein viral
antigen(s) on the cell surface. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact
with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently. mRNA vaccines have been used
to
induce
immune
responses
against
infectious
pathogens
such
as
cytomegalovirus
(NCT03382405), human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus type 3 (NCT03392389), Zika
virus (NCT03325075), and influenza virus (NCT03076385 and NCT03345043).
The Sponsor is using its mRNA-based platform to develop a novel lipid nanoparticle
(LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (mRNA-1273). mRNA-1273
encodes for the full-length spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, modified to introduce 2 proline
residues to stabilize the S protein (S-2P) in a prefusion conformation. The CoV S protein mediates

attachment and entry of the virus into host cells (by fusion), making it a primary target for
neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that prevent infection (Johnson et al 2016; Wang et al 2015;
Wang et al 2018; Chen et al 2017; Corti et al 2015; Yu et al 2015; Kim et al 2019; Widjaja et al
2019). It has been confirmed that the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S-2P antigen presents in the correct
prefusion conformation (Wrapp et al 2020).
The development of the mRNA-1273 vaccine is being accelerated to address the current
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a result of the uniquely rapid and scalable manufacturing process for
mRNA-1273. The primary goal of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the VE of mRNA-1273 to
prevent COVID-19, compared to placebo.
2.2.1.
Nonclinical Studies
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that CoV S proteins are immunogenic and S protein-based
vaccines, including those based on mRNA delivery platforms, are protective in animals. Prior
clinical studies of vaccines targeting related CoVs and other viruses have demonstrated that
mRNA-based vaccines are safe and immunogenic. It is therefore anticipated that mRNA-1273 will
generate robust immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and will be well tolerated. In
addition, mRNA-1273 has shown preliminary evidence of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in a
murine model of infection (data on file).
In support of development of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection,
nonclinical immunogenicity, biodistribution, and safety studies have been completed with similar
mRNA-based
vaccines
formulated
in
LNPs
containing
, the novel proprietary lipid used
in the mRNA-1273 LNP formulation.
A detailed review of nonclinical experience with mRNA-1273 vaccine is provided in the
investigator’s brochure (IB).
2.2.2.
Clinical Studies
The mRNA-1273 vaccine is currently being evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a
dose-ranging Phase 1 study (NCT04283461) sponsored and conducted by the Division of
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID). The Phase 1 DMID study is an open-label dose-ranging study of mRNA-1273
in healthy adult male and non-pregnant female participants in 3 age groups: age 18 to 55 years,
inclusive (45 participants); age 56 to 70 years, inclusive (30 participants); and ≥71 years
(30 participants). Each participant received an intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 mL) of
mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle and will be followed for 13 months after the
second injection. Sera obtained from 41 participants who were convalescing from COVID-19 were
included as a comparative control.

A total of 120 participants were enrolled, and 116 participants received the second injection. Three
mRNA-1273 dose levels (25, 50, and 100 µg) administered 28 days apart have been assessed in
participants 18 to 55 years, 56 to 70 years, and ≥71 years of age. The mRNA-1273 250-µg dose
was not evaluated in participants 56 to 70 years and ≥71 years of age due to reactogenicity
observed in 4 participants in the 250 µg (18 to 55 years) dose cohort. Across all age groups,
solicited adverse reactions (ARs) were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most
commonly included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. The incidence
and severity of solicited ARs were generally dose dependent and increases in incidence and
severity were generally observed after the second injection. The incidence of systemic reactions
increased after the second injection, particularly at the highest (250 µg) dose. Four (27%)
participants in the 250 μg dose cohort reported at least 1 severe solicited AR after the second
injection, including feverishness, fatigue, fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, and erythema/redness.
No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported through Day 119, and no pause rules were
triggered during the study. mRNA-1273 induced robust binding antibody (bAb) responses after
2 injections. Notably, 100 µg of mRNA-1273 resulted in numerically higher S-2P-specific binding
titers than 25 µg and 50 µg of mRNA-1273 in all age groups. Two injections of mRNA-1273 also
induced robust nAb responses. The nAb response was marginal after the first injection but
increased substantially after the second injection. The nAb response assessed by a pseudovirus
neutralization assay at the 100 µg mRNA-1273 dose level was similar to that at the 250 µg
mRNA-1273 dose level in the 18 to 55 years of age group and numerically higher than that
observed at the 25 µg and 50 µg mRNA-1273 dose levels in the older age groups. The nAb
response at the 100 µg dose level was similar across all age groups.
mRNA-1273-P201 (Study 201; NCT04405076) is an ongoing Phase 2a, safety, reactogenicity, and
immunogenicity study in healthy adults that provided confirmation of the immunogenicity of both
the 100 μg and 50 µg doses. The study was designed as a randomized, observer-blind,
placebo-controlled dose confirmation study (Part A). Two mRNA-1273 dose levels, 50 μg and
100 μg, and placebo were evaluated in 2 age cohorts: Cohort 1 enrolled participants ≥18 to
< 55 years
old
(300 participants),
and
Cohort 2
enrolled
participants
≥55 years
old
(300 participants). A total of 600 participants received either mRNA-1273 or placebo according
to a 1:1:1 randomization ratio; ie, within each age cohort, 100 participants each received
mRNA-1273 50 μg, mRNA-1273 100 μg, or placebo. mRNA-1273 demonstrated an acceptable
safety profile in the participant population enrolled in this study at both dose levels and both age
cohorts, as observed through 6 months after the second injection.
An amendment to the Study 201 protocol adapted the study design to include open-label
interventional phases (Part B and Part C). Part B allowed unblinding of participants and offered
2 injections of mRNA-1273 in an open-label manner, 28 days apart, to all participants who
received placebo in Part A. Part B also offered a single booster dose (BD) of mRNA-1273 (50 μg)

to participants who received 1 or 2 doses of mRNA-1273 (50 μg or 100 μg) in Part A at least
6 months prior. Part C was prompted by the need to proactively prepare for vaccination strategies
that induce broader protection, including against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 such as
B.1.351. Part C enrolled participants from Study 301 who received 2 doses of mRNA-1273 100 μg
at least 6 months prior. Part C participants received a single injection of mRNA-1273.351 (20 μg
or 50 μg) or mRNA-1273.351 mixture (50 μg total – 25 μg of mRNA-1273 and 25 μg of
mRNA-1273.351).
Vaccination with mRNA-1273 in Study 201 resulted in robust immune responses to SARS-CoV-2
in participants 18 years and older at both dose levels, and persistence of immune response was
observed up to 6 months after the second injection in Part A of the study. In Part A of Study 201,
the time course and magnitude of antibody (Ab; both bAb and nAb) responses to mRNA-1273
was similar between 100 µg and 50 µg dose levels at each postbaseline timepoint (Days 29, 43,
57, and 209), although the 100 µg dose group had numerically greater responses. In Part B of
Study 201, administration of a 50 µg BD of mRNA-1273 6 months or more after the primary series
improved the immune responses to 1.7-fold the peak achieved after the primary vaccination series
in the current mRNA-1273-P301 study, where efficacy of mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 was
demonstrated.
This present ongoing Phase 3 study (mRNA-1273-P301) is a pivotal Phase 3, efficacy, safety, and
immunogenicity study that has provided the primary clinical evidence of VE and safety (see
Section 4 for details of the study design). The study was designed as a randomized, observer and
participant blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of
mRNA-1273 compared to placebo. More than 30,000 participants 18 years of age and older were
randomized 1:1 to mRNA-1273 100 μg or placebo based on 3 strata: ≥65 years of age, 18 to
< 65 years of age and at increased risk for complications of COVID-19, and 18 to < 65 years of
age and not at risk. The initial mRNA-1273 100 µg dose was followed by a second 100 µg dose
28 days later. Participants are being followed for efficacy and safety until 24 months after the
second dose. Vaccine efficacy was demonstrated based on the prespecified efficacy success
criterion at the interim analysis (IA) (11 Nov 2020 dataset), based on a total of 95 adjudicated
COVID-19 cases. The subsequent primary analysis of efficacy was performed with a total of
196 adjudicated COVID-19 cases (25 Nov 2020 dataset) and was consistent with the IA.
mRNA-1273 was subsequently granted emergency use authorization (EUA) in the US and
conditional approvals worldwide.
After EUA in the US was granted for mRNA-1273 and another mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Part B,
the Open-Label Observational Phase of the study was initiated. All participants in Part A were
invited to proceed to Part B, starting with a participant decision visit (PDV) at the study site, at
which participants were given the option to be unblinded to their original group assignment or

remain blinded. Unblinded participants who had received placebo in Part A had the choice to be
vaccinated with mRNA-1273 in Part B.
On 25 Aug 2021, Moderna announced that it had completed the rolling submission process for its
Biologics License Application (BLA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the full
licensure of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) for active immunization to prevent
COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. mRNA-1273 showed durable efficacy of 93%
through 6 months after the second dose. mRNA-1273 was highly immunogenic as measured by
both bAb and nAb in both SARS-CoV-2 baseline-negative and baseline-positive individuals, as
indicated by increased bAb and nAb levels 1 month after first injection (Day 29) and 1 month after
second injection (Day 57). mRNA-1273 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in the
participant population enrolled in this study, having a reactogenicity profile consistent with
parenteral vaccination and was generally well tolerated. No unexpected findings were identified
in the final assessment of the randomized, blinded phase of the study (Part A).
Protocol mRNA-1273-P301 Amendment 9 initiated Part C of the study (Section 4.1.3), providing
for administration of a BD of mRNA-1273.
2.3.
Benefit/Risk Assessment
2.3.1.
Potential Benefits of Study Participation
The target study population for this study is adults with no known history of SARS-CoV-2
infection but whose locations or circumstances put them at high risk of COVID-19. The following
benefits may accrue to participants:
•
The mRNA-1273 vaccine may be an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
•
A baseline (Day 1) evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 infection and ongoing surveillance for
COVID-19 throughout the study.
•
Contributing to the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, a current pandemic
disease.
2.3.2.
Risks From Study Participation
Immediate systemic allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) can occur following any vaccination.
These reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,000 vaccinations for vaccines
that do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein (Zent et al 2002). As a precaution, all
participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes after vaccination.
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by the
pain or anxiety caused by the injection, and is not related to the substance injected. Therefore, it is
important that standard precautions and procedures be followed to avoid injury from fainting.

Intramuscular injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by the Sponsor containing the
lipid formulation commonly results in a transient and self-limiting local inflammatory
reaction. This typically includes pain, erythema (redness), or swelling (hardness) at the injection
site, which are mostly mild to moderate in severity and usually occur within 24 hours of
vaccination. More severe but self-limited local reactions, erythema and induration, have been
observed at doses of mRNA-1273 exceeding the dose proposed in this study.
Most systemic ARs observed after vaccination do not exceed Grade 1 to Grade 2 in severity. The
most commonly reported systemic ARs are anticipated to be fever, fatigue, chills, headache,
myalgias, and arthralgias. More severe reactions, including erythema, induration, fever, headache,
and nausea were reported after receiving doses of mRNA-1273 that were greater than the dose
proposed for use in this study. In all cases, the reactions resolved spontaneously.
Laboratory abnormalities (including increases in liver functional tests and serum lipase levels)
following vaccination were observed in clinical studies with similar mRNA-based vaccines. These
abnormalities were without clinical symptoms or signs and returned toward baseline (Day 1)
values over time. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Further details are
provided in the current IB.
There is a theoretical risk that active vaccination to prevent the novel viral infection caused by
SARS-CoV-2 may cause a paradoxical increase in the risk of disease. This possibility is based on
the rare phenomenon of vaccine-associated disease enhancement which was first seen in the 1960s
with 2 vaccines made in the same way (formalin-inactivated whole virus) and designed to protect
children against infection with respiratory syncytial virus (Chin et al 1969) or measles (Fulginiti et
al 1967). Disease enhancement has also been proposed as a possible explanation for cases of more
serious disease associated with dengue vaccination (Thomas and Yoon 2019; WHO 2019).
To monitor the risk of enhanced disease in this study, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring
Board (DSMB) will review unblinded cases of COVID-19 to assess for inefficacy and also for
numerical imbalance in cases of both COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 with the purpose of
providing a non-binding recommendation to the Sponsor (Section 8.4.2). To date, clinical
immunogenicity data from the DMID Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 demonstrated high levels of
nAbs and Th-1-polarized CD4+ T-cell responses (Jackson et al 2020). In addition, in Study P301,
after a median follow-up of 2 months after the second dose of vaccine, the overwhelming majority
of COVID-19 cases occurred in participants who received placebo rather than mRNA-1273
(Baden et al 2020), consistent with a low risk of enhanced respiratory disease following
vaccination with mRNA-1273. These data suggest that a paradoxical increase in the risk of disease,
while not eliminated, is likely to be low. Further details are provided in the current IB.
In the context of the EUA for individuals 18 years and older for mRNA-1273, there have been
very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with Moderna

COVID-19 vaccine. Further details about this risk are described in the Fact Sheets (available on
www.fda.gov). Although causality has not been established, the majority of the cases have been
reported in young males shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases
and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest
(Gargano et al 2021).
The adverse events (AEs) after getting a third dose of mRNA-1273 are currently being studied. It
is unknown if the AEs after getting a third dose of mRNA-1273 are different from getting 2 doses
of mRNA-1273. Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit-risk profile of a BD of mRNA-1273
is favorable, particularly in light of increasing breakthrough disease with the emergence of
variants.
2.3.3.
Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion
All participants will be included based on their increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Accordingly, all will benefit from baseline and ongoing evaluations for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Since this is a placebo-controlled study (Section 4), half the participants will have the potential to
receive mRNA-1273 vaccine, the efficacy of which is unknown at present. Vaccination with
mRNA-1273 may not prevent COVID-19 in all vaccinees.
Participants who receive placebo as part of this study may have an opportunity cost of not being
treated with another investigational vaccine against COVID-19.
The placebo for this study is a saline solution, without any LNP. Thus, participants receiving saline
may be at lower risk of AEs related to injection than participants receiving mRNA-1273.
Safety findings will be monitored and periodically reviewed by the DSMB to evaluate the safety
and treatment status of all participants. The DSMB will review and assess the safety data as
described in Section 8.4.2.
Considering the lack of approved vaccines for COVID-19 prior to initiation of the study, the
participants’ risk of COVID-19 outside the study, and the nonclinical and clinical data to date, the
Sponsor considers the potential benefits of participation to exceed the risks.
Based on the interim results from the pivotal Phase 3 study, mRNA-1273 prevents COVID-19 and
severe COVID-19. The demonstrated clinical benefit of mRNA-1273 is supported by evidence of
a robust immune response both in terms of bAbs and nAbs as well as the induction of CD4+ T-cells
with a Th-1 dominant phenotype. Based on administration of mRNA-1273 to approximately
15,693 adults across all 3 clinical studies to date, there have been no emergent safety concerns and
the AE profile is manifested largely by mild to moderate reactogenicity lasting 2 to 3 days.
Additionally, interim results of the ongoing Moderna Phase 2a study (mRNA-1273-P201)
demonstrate a favorable benefit-risk profile of a BD of mRNA-1273.

STUDY DESIGN
4.1.
General Design
This is a 3-part Phase 3 study, comprising Part A, Part B, and Part C. Participants in Part A, the
Blinded Phase of this study, were blinded to their treatment assignment. Given that the primary
efficacy endpoint for mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 was met per the protocol-defined IA, Part B,
the Open-Label Observational Phase of this study, was designed to offer eligible participants who
received placebo in Part A of this study an option to request open-label mRNA-1273, subject to
availability of investigational vaccine (Figure 1). Part C, the Booster Dose Phase, providing for an
mRNA-1273 BD, is designed to offer eligible participants the option to request a BD of
mRNA-1273.
Upon entry into Part A, all participants had 8 scheduled clinic visits, including Screening, Day 1,
Day 29, Day 57, Day 209, Day 394, Day 759, as specified in the Schedules of Events (SoEs)
(Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, Table 19). With the initiation of Part B, a PDV was scheduled for
all participants currently enrolled in Part A at that time (Table 20) and participants eligible for
Part B dosing may have had up to 2 additional scheduled clinic visits as specified in SoEs (Table 21
and Table 22). Part C will begin with a BD-1 visit (see SoE; Table 23) scheduled for all
participants currently enrolled in Part B, and participants deciding to receive a BD may have up to
3 additional clinic visits scheduled (Section 4.1.3; Table 23).
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and
all applicable regulatory requirements.
4.1.1.
Part A, the Blinded Phase
The Blinded Phase of this study is a randomized, stratified, observer-blind, placebo-controlled
evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
compared to placebo in adults 18 years of age and older who have no known history of
SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose locations or circumstances put them at appreciable risk of
acquiring COVID-19 and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Figure 1 shows the study flow and
Appendix 1 (Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, and Table 19) presents the planned SoEs.
Approximately 30,000 participants will be randomly assigned to receive doses of either 100 µg of
mRNA-1273 vaccine or a placebo control in a 1:1 randomization ratio. Assignment will be
stratified by age and health risk (Section 6.2.1.1). This is a case-driven study and thus final sample
size of the study will depend on the actual attack rate of COVID-19.
All participants will be assessed for efficacy and safety endpoints and provide a nasopharyngeal
(NP) swab sample and blood sample before the first and second dose of investigational product
(IP), in addition to a series of post-dose blood samples for immunogenicity through 24 months

after the second dose of IP. Efficacy assessments will include surveillance for COVID-19 with
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection
after the first and second dose of IP. As noted above, this is a case-driven study: if the prespecified
criteria for early efficacy are met at the time of either IA or overall efficacy at the primary analysis,
a final study report describing the efficacy and safety of mRNA-1273 will be prepared based on
the data available at that time. In the event that success criteria are met either at the time of the IA
or when the total number of cases toward the primary endpoint have accrued, participants will
continue to be followed in a blinded fashion until Month 25 to enable assessment of long-term
safety and durability of VE. If the study concludes early, all participants will be requested to
provide a final blood sample at the time of study conclusion.
Each participant will receive 2 doses of IP by 0.5 mL IM injection, the first on Day 1 and the
second on Day 29. An NP swab sample will be collected prior to the first and second dose of IP
for evaluation by RT-PCR. To preserve observer blinding, only delegated unblinded study
personnel responsible for study vaccine preparation, administration and/or accountability will have
knowledge of study treatment assignment (Section 6.2.8.1).
Participants will be given an electronic diary (eDiary) to report solicited ARs for 7 days after each
dose of IP and to prompt an unscheduled clinic visit for clinical evaluation and NP swab sample if
a participant experiences any symptoms of COVID-19 (throughout study). Participants will use
the eDiary to report solicited ARs for 7 days after each dose of IP and weekly eDiary prompts
(every 7 days) to elicit an unscheduled Illness Visit if the participant is experiencing COVID-19
symptoms. All participants will receive safety calls on Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 36, and Day 43
that will serve both to monitor for unsolicited AEs and to monitor for symptoms of COVID-19.
Safety telephone calls and eDiary safety prompts will be performed in conjunction with
surveillance for COVID-19 according to the SoEs (Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, and Table 19)
and are intended to capture SAEs, medically attended AEs (MAAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal,
concomitant medications associated with these events, receipt of non-study vaccinations, and
pregnancy (Section 8.2.1). If an eDiary prompt results in identification of a relevant safety event,
a follow-up safety call will be triggered.
Surveillance for COVID-19 will be performed through weekly contacts with the participant via a
combination of telephone calls and completion of an eDiary starting at Day 1 through the end of
the study (Section 8.1.2). Participants with symptoms of COVID-19 lasting at least 48 hours
(except for fever and/or respiratory symptoms) will return to the clinic or will be visited at home
by medically qualified site staff within 72 hours to collect an NP swab sample for RT-PCR testing
for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens, or alternatively, if a clinic or home visit is not
possible, will submit a saliva sample for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing (Section 8.1.1).

All study participants who experience COVID-19 symptoms and subsequently present for an
Illness Visit (in-clinic or at home) will be given an instruction card listing symptoms and severity
grading system along with a thermometer, an oxygen saturation monitor, and saliva collection
tubes. The list of symptoms is presented in Section 8.1.2 and the severity scoring system is
presented in Section 8.1.3. Study participants will be contacted by the investigator (or
appropriately delegated study staff) daily with telemedicine visits through Day 14 (from the Illness
Visit or initial COVID-19 contact) or until symptoms have resolved, whichever is later, and which
may include symptoms persisting longer than the 28-day Convalescent Period. If symptoms persist
beyond Day 60, then telemedicine calls can be reduced to weekly; however, the participant should
still report the daily symptoms at that contact. During the telemedicine visit (preferably done in
the evening), the participant will be asked to verbally report the severity of each symptom and
their highest body temperature and lowest oxygen saturation for that day, and the investigator will
determine if medical attention is required due to worsening of COVID-19 symptoms (Table 19).
Study participants will collect their own saliva sample on 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, and 21 days after the initial
Illness Visit meeting criteria for COVID-19 (defined as the date of onset of symptoms and positive
virologic test). Finally, a Convalescent Visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days after the
initial Illness Visit. At this visit, a saliva sample will be collected and a blood sample will be drawn
for immunologic assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
At each dosing visit, participants will be instructed (Day 1) or reminded (Day 29) on how to
document and report solicited ARs in the eDiary provided. Solicited ARs will be assessed for
7 days after each IP dose and unsolicited AEs will be assessed for 28 days after each IP dose;
SAEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, will be assessed throughout the study.
Participants may experience AEs that necessitate an unscheduled visit. There may also be
situations in which the investigator asks a participant to report for an unscheduled visit following
the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be conducted at these visits as necessary to
ensure the safety and well-being of participants during the study. Electronic case report forms
(eCRFs) should be completed for each unscheduled visit.
4.1.2.
Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase
The Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase of the study is prompted by the authorization of
a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA. Transitioning the study to Part B permits all ongoing study
participants to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any COVID-19 vaccine
made available under an EUA and the option to offer all ongoing study participants who request
unblinding an opportunity to schedule a PDV to learn their original treatment assignment (placebo
vs. mRNA-1273 vaccine).

Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase of the study, also provides the opportunity for eligible
study participants who previously received placebo, to actively request to receive 2 doses of
mRNA-1273 vaccine (as long as investigational vaccine is available). All study participants will
receive a notification letter and will be asked to schedule a PDV. Principal Investigators should
consider current local public health guidance for administration of COVID-19 vaccines under
EUA when determining the scheduling priority of participants. With regard to eligibility in Part B,
the CDC-EUA guidance specifications will supersede eligibility criteria in the protocol.
All participants will proceed to Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase of the study, starting
with a PDV (Figure 2).
At the PDV, all participants will:
•
Be encouraged to remain in the ongoing study,
•
Be given the option to be unblinded as to their original group assignment (placebo vs.
mRNA-1273 vaccine),
•
Be counselled about the importance of continuing other public health measures to limit the
spread of disease including social distancing, wearing a mask, and hand-washing,
•
Sign a revised informed consent form (ICF),
•
Provide an NP swab sample for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and a blood sample for serology
prior to unblinding.
Figure 2 shows the Part B Study Flow schematic.
The following participants will continue with the original study SoEs presented in Table 16,
Table 17, Table 18, and Table 19 (Figure 2):
•
Participants who request to not be unblinded,
•
Participants who request to be unblinded and received mRNA-1273, and
•
Participants who request to be unblinded and received placebo and choose to remain on
placebo.
Participants who are unblinded, received placebo, are eligible, and request to receive mRNA-1273
(as long as investigational vaccine is available) (Figure 2), will have the following clinic visits as
shown in the Supplemental SoE (Table 21):
•
Open-label Dose 1 (OL-D1): To occur at the PDV or at a scheduled subsequent visit.
•
Open-label Dose 2 (OL-D29): To occur 28 days after Dose 1 on OL-D1.
•
Open-label Clinic Visit (OL-D57): To occur 1 month after Dose 2 on OL-D29.

•
And in addition, continue to comply with the Original Study SoEs (Table 16, Table 17,
Table 18, and Table 19) as applicable.
•
Participants who are unblinded, and received ONLY 1 dose of mRNA-1273 may be
eligible to receive 1 more dose of mRNA-1273 if: They had a dosing error in Part A of the
study that resulted in 1 dose of mRNA-1273 and 1 dose of placebo being administered.
•
They did not have an AE that contraindicated the second dose of mRNA-1273 in Part A of
the study.
•
They did not withdraw consent in Part A of the study.
•
They did not complete their second dose in Part A of the study for reasons other than the
above.
If participants are eligible, and request to receive mRNA-1273 (Figure 2) will proceed to have the
following clinic visits as shown in the Modified Supplemental SoEs (Table 22):
•
Their second dose on OL-D1: To occur at the PDV or at a scheduled subsequent visit.
•
Open-label Clinic Visit (OL-D29): To occur 1 month after Dose 2 on OL-D1.
•
And in addition, continue to comply with the Original Study SoEs (Table 16, Table 17,
Table 18, and Table 19) as applicable.
All participants remain on their original SoE to complete 24 months of follow-up after Dose 2;
study participants who enter the Supplemental/Modified Supplemental SoE as described above do
so in addition to their original SoE. Accordingly, all study participants will complete the full study
follow-up to 24 months after the second dose of their original inoculation (mRNA-1273 or
placebo) or 25 months after the first dose if the second dose is missed.
At the point when the mRNA-1273 vaccine is no longer available for study use, any participant
who schedules a PDV after this timepoint will be unblinded (with no option to stay blinded) but
will not be offered to receive mRNA-1273 study vaccine. These participants will have all the same
procedures performed as outlined in Table 20 with the exception of being offered to receive
mRNA-1273 vaccine. There will be no scientific metric or ethical advantage for participants to
remain blinded when most of the study has already been unblinded. If the participant wants to
receive EUA vaccine outside of the study after being unblinded, they will need to be withdrawn
from the study.
After the BLA database lock (on 04 May 2021), any remaining participants who had not been
unblinded were unblinded by the Moderna study team and received their unblinding treatment
assignment (placebo vs. mRNA vaccine) via certified letter from the study site. These participants
were not required to return to the site for an NP swab sample or blood draw.

Part C, the Booster Dose Phase
Part C, the Booster Dose Phase providing a BD for all eligible participants who chose to receive
one, is prompted by interim results of an ongoing Moderna Phase 2a study (mRNA-1273-P201),
as described in Section 4.2.
Each study participant will receive a notification letter and will be asked to schedule a BD-1 visit
at their study site (Table 23). Principal Investigators should consider current local public health
guidance for administration of COVID-19 vaccines under EUA and marketing authorization (if
any) when determining the scheduling priority of participants. At the BD-1 visit, each participant
will:
•
Be encouraged to remain in the ongoing study,
•
Sign a revised ICF that includes both updated safety information relevant to the ongoing
study and a BD, and the option to receive a BD,
•
Be given the option to receive a BD consisting of a 50 µg dose of mRNA-1273,
•
Be counselled about the importance of continuing other public health measures to limit the
spread of disease including social distancing, wearing a mask, and hand-washing.
After the BD-1 visit, participants who do not receive a BD will continue with the Part C
Supplemental SoE for the BD-2 and BD-3 visits but will not have the BD-1a visit or the safety
calls (Table 23).
Participants who request a BD and are eligible and have no contraindications to further dosing (see
Section 7.1) will have the following study site visits and complete scheduled activities (subject to
investigational vaccine availability) according to the Part C Supplemental SoE (Table 23):
•
BD-1 visit: Participants will receive a single 50 µg dose of mRNA-1273.
•
BD-1a visit: Optional, and subject to blood sample kit availability, Day 4, 3 days after BD
on Day 1.
•
BD-2 visit: Day 29, 28 days after the BD on Day 1.
•
BD-3 visit: Day 181, 180 days after the BD on Day 1.
The investigator is responsible for conducting all assessments as specified in the Part C
Supplemental SoE, according to the schedule. As this Supplemental SoE is intended to occur in
addition to the original SoEs (Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, and Table 19) being followed by all
participants in Part B, there is a possibility for study visits to overlap. If visits overlap according
to respective visit windows, a single visit may be done with the combined study procedures
completed once (refer to Table 4 footnotes for more detailed instructions and exceptions).

Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The mRNA-1273 vaccine is being developed to prevent COVID-19, the disease resulting from
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study has been designed to primarily evaluate the clinical
efficacy and safety of mRNA-1273 to prevent COVID-19 for up to 2 years after the planned second
dose of mRNA-1273. The immunogenicity endpoints and detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection are
secondary objectives.
The design and focus of the study as designed for Part A were dependent on the then current
COVID-19 pandemic, requiring identification of participant candidates at high risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. This Phase 3 study was designed to be a randomized, stratified,
observer-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of
mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compared to placebo in adults 18 years of age and older who
had no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose locations or circumstances put them at
appreciable risk of acquiring COVID-19 and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Following authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA, the study design was amended to
include a transition to Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase (Section 2.2.2). The
demonstration of efficacy against COVID-19 with satisfactory safety data, at a time when the
COVID-19 pandemic remained critical, warranted allowing those study participants who actively
requested it to know their original assignment (placebo or mRNA-1273 vaccine) on study.
Transitioning the study to the Open-Label Observational Phase permitted all ongoing study
participants (a) to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any COVID-19 vaccine
made available under an EUA and (b) to schedule a study visit to know their original group
assignment (placebo vs. mRNA-1273 vaccine). Part B also provided the opportunity for eligible
study participants who previously received placebo to receive 2 doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine
under open-label conditions. Prompted by the anticipated recommendations from the FDA and
CDC regarding boosters, this study design was further amended to include a transition to Part C,
the Open-Label Observational BD Phase. The interim results of an ongoing Moderna Phase 2a
study (mRNA-1273-P201; NCT04405076), in which participants who, 6 to 8 months prior,
received 2 doses of 50 µg or 100 µg of mRNA-1273 were administered a 50 µg booster of
mRNA-1273. Results demonstrated enhanced immune responses compared to pre-boost levels and
met the noninferiority criteria stipulated in the FDA Guidance on EUA for Vaccines to Prevent
COVID-19 (DHHS 2021). In addition, no new safety signals emerged upon administration of the
BD in Study mRNA-1273-P201. Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit-risk profile of a BD
of mRNA-1273 is favorable, particularly in light of increasing breakthrough disease with the
emergence of variants. With the wider availability of boosters under EUA, providing the option of
a BD to all eligible participants currently enrolled in Part B is expected to promote retention of
participants in the ongoing study and thereby defend the scientific integrity of the study for the

Choice of Dose and Control Product
The primary vaccination series originally selected for Part A of this study, 2 doses of 100 µg
mRNA-1273 administered 28 days apart, was based on assessment of available safety and
immunogenicity data from Phase 1 studies of mRNA-1647 (NCT03382405), the DMID study
20-0003 entitled “Phase I, Open-Label, Dose-Ranging Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of
2019-nCoV Vaccine (mRNA-1273) in Healthy Adults” (NCT04283461) and Study 201
(Section 2.2.2). The primary vaccination series (at the 100-µg dose level) used in this study is
being used in these studies, with evidence of safety and immunogenicity. At the time Part A was
initiated, there was no licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine currently available to serve as a reference
control; accordingly, 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) injection (United States Pharmacopeia
[USP]) was used as a placebo control during Part A.
For Part C, the provision of the option of a single BD for eligible participants during the
Open-Label Observational Phase, the BD selected is 50 µg, based primarily on data from
Study mRNA-1273-P201. In Part A of Study mRNA-1273-P201, the time course and magnitude
of Ab (both bAb and nAb) responses to mRNA-1273 was similar between 100 µg and 50 µg dose
levels at each postbaseline timepoint (Days 29, 43, 57, and 209), although the 100-µg dose group
had numerically greater responses. In Part B of Study mRNA-1273-P201, administration of a
50 µg BD of mRNA-1273 6 months or more after the primary series improved the immune
responses to 1.7-fold the peak achieved after the primary vaccination series in the current
mRNA-1273-P301 study, where efficacy of mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 was demonstrated.

End of Study Definition
Participants are considered to have completed the study if they complete the final visit at Day 759
(Month 25), 24 months following their receipt of the original second dose of IP (where original
refers to the IP received following randomization); if a participant did not receive a second dose
of IP, their follow-up will be 25 months after first dose of IP. For participants who enter Part C, if
visit BD-3 falls after Day 759 (Month 25), then BD-3 will be the final visit.
The study duration will be approximately 26 months for each participant. This includes a screening
period of up to 1 month and a study period of 25 months that includes the first dose of IP on Day 1
and the second dose on Day 29 (Part A). The participant's final scheduled visit will be on Day 759
(Month 25), 24 months after the second dose of IP on Day 29 (Month 1) or 25 months after the
first dose if the second dose is missed. For participants who enter Part C, if visit BD-3 falls after
Day 759 (Month 25), then BD-3 will be the final visit.

STUDY POPULATION
The study population, adults at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection who have no known history of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, is a subset of the planned target population. Additionally, potential study
participants at increased risk of complications from COVID-19 will be included since it is
hypothesized that these participants might derive the greatest benefit from a vaccine. Participants
≥65 years of age will be eligible for enrollment with or without underlying medical conditions
further increasing their risk of severe COVID-19.
Given the disproportionate disease burden of COVID-19 in racial and ethnic minorities, the study
will also aim to enroll a representative sample of participants from these minority population and
adjust site selection and enrollment accordingly, per FDA Draft Guidance “Enhancing the
Diversity of Clinical Trial Populations - Eligibility Criteria, Enrollment Practices, and Trial
Designs” (DHHS 2020b). Study sites may be selected on the basis of SARS-COV-2 infection risk
of the local population as well. Approximately 30,000 participants will be enrolled.
There will be no prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria
(also known as protocol waivers or exemptions).
5.1.

STUDY TREATMENT
6.1.
Investigational Product
The term “investigational product” refers to both mRNA-1273 vaccine (blinded and open-label)
and placebo administered in this study.
The mRNA-1273 IP is an LNP dispersion of an mRNA encoding the prefusion stabilized S protein
of SARS-CoV-2 formulated in LNPs composed of 4 lipids (1 proprietary and 3 commercially
available): the proprietary ionizable lipid SM-102; cholesterol; 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-
3-phosphocholine (DSPC); and 1-monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-2,3-dimyristylglycerol with
polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 2000 (PEG2000-DMG). The mRNA-1273
vaccine is provided as a sterile liquid for injection and is a white to off-white dispersion in
appearance, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 87 mg/mL sucrose
and 10.7 mM sodium acetate at pH 7.5.
The placebo is 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) injection, which meets the criteria of the
USP.
6.2.
Dosing and Management of Investigational Product
6.2.1.
Method of Randomly Assigning Participants to Treatment Groups (Part A,
Blinded Phase Only)
Approximately 30,000 participants will be randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive either
mRNA-1273 100 µg or placebo. The randomization will be in a blinded manner using a centralized
interactive response technology (IRT), in accordance with pre-generated randomization schedules.
Only the unblinded personnel (Section 6.2.8.1) will have controlled access to which arm the
participant is randomly assigned.
Dose group assignment in is summarized in Table 2.

Stratification
Randomization in Part A, Blinded Phase of the study will be stratified based on age and, if they
are < 65 years of age, based on the presence or absence of risk factors for severe illness from
COVID-19 based on CDC recommendation as of March 2020 (CDC 2020b). There will be 3 strata

for randomization: ≥65 years, < 65 years and categorized to be at increased risk (“at risk”) for the
complications of COVID-19, and < 65 years “not at risk.” Risk will be defined based on the study
participants’ relevant past and current medical history. At least 25% of enrolled participants, up to
50%, will be either ≥65 years of age or < 65 years of age and “at risk” at Screening.
Participants who are < 65 years old will be categorized as at risk for severe COVID-19 illness if
they have at least 1 of the following risk factors at Screening:
•
Chronic lung disease (eg, emphysema and chronic bronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis and cystic fibrosis) or moderate to severe asthma
•
Significant cardiac disease (eg, heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart
disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension)
•
Severe obesity (body mass index ≥40 kg/m2)
•
Diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, or gestational)
•
Liver disease
•
HIV infection
6.2.2.
Administration of Investigational Product
In Part A and Part B, as applicable, IP will be administered as an IM injection into the deltoid
muscle on a 2-dose injection schedule on Day 1 and Day 29. For injections administered for Part A
and Part B, each injection will have a volume of 0.5 mL and contain mRNA-1273 100 µg or saline
placebo. For Part C, each injection will have a volume of 0.25 mL and contain mRNA-1273 50 µg.
Preferably, vaccine should be administered into the nondominant arm. The second dose of IP
should be administered in the same arm as the first dose (Part A and Part B, as applicable).
The IP will be prepared for injection as a single 0.5 mL (Part A and Part B) or 0.25 mL (Part C)
dose for each participant per protocol, as detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Unblinded personnel
who will not participate in any other aspect of the study during Part A, the Blinded Phase, will
perform IP accountability, dose preparation, and IP administration. The investigator will designate
unblinded medically qualified personnel (not involved in assessments of study endpoints) to
administer the IP according to the procedures stipulated in this study protocol (Part A, the Blinded
Phase), and Pharmacy Manual. Study-specific training will be provided. Study site personnel who
were blinded during the Blinded Phase will be unblinded at the participant level at the PDV.
At each visit when IP is administered, participants will be monitored for a minimum of 30 minutes
after administration. Assessments will include vital sign measurements and monitoring for local
or systemic reactions (Table 16, Table 21, Table 22, and Table 23).
Eligibility for a subsequent dose of IP is determined by following the criteria outlined in Section 7.

The study site will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary
resuscitation training/certification. Either on-site resuscitation equipment and personnel or
appropriate protocols for the rapid transport of participant to a resuscitation area/facility are
required.
6.2.3.
Delivery and Receipt
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the following:
•
Supplying the IP
•
Confirming the appropriate labeling of mRNA-1273 IP, so that it complies with the legal
requirements of the US
The investigator is responsible for acknowledging the receipt of the IP by a designated staff
member at the site, including the following:
•
Confirming that the IP was received in good condition
•
Confirmation that the temperature during shipment from the Sponsor to the investigator’s
designated storage location was appropriate
•
Confirming whether the Sponsor has authorized the IP for use
•
Ensuring the appropriate dose level of mRNA-1273 is properly prepared using aseptic
technique
Further description of the IP and instructions for the receipt, storage, preparation, administration,
accountability, and destruction of the IP are described in the mRNA-1273-P201 Pharmacy Manual.
6.2.4.
Packaging and Labeling
The Sponsor will provide the investigator and study site with adequate quantities of mRNA-1273.
The sterile vaccine product is packaged in a 10R glass vial with a 5.0-mL or 6.3-mL fill volume
(Part A and Part B) or a 10R glass vial with an 8.0 mL fill volume (Part C). mRNA-1273 vaccine
will have all required labeling per regulations and will be supplied to the pharmacy in an unblinded
manner. Each vial will be individually labeled for future participant identification purposes.
mRNA-1273 will be packaged and labeled in accordance with the standard operating procedures
of the Sponsor or of its designee, Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (CFR), Good
Manufacturing Practice guidelines, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) GCP
guidelines, guidelines for Quality System Regulations, and applicable regulations.
The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee will supply the 0.9% sodium chloride injection for use as both
a placebo and a diluent to mRNA-1273. The 0.9% sodium chloride bears a commercial label and
does not contain study-specific identification (Part A only).

6.2.5.
Storage
The vials of mRNA-1273 with 5.0 ml fill volume must be stored at 2°C to 8°C in a secure area
with limited access (unblinded personnel only) and protected from moisture and light until it is
prepared for administration (Section 6.2.2). The vials of mRNA-1273 with 6.3 mL or 8.0 mL fill
volume must be stored at -20°C in a secure area with limited access and protected from moisture
and light until it is prepared for administration. The vials of mRNA-1273 with 6.3 mL fill volume
can be stored at 2°C to 8°C for up to 30 days, but site personnel must account for this manually as
it will not be managed in the IRT system. The freezer or refrigerator should have automated
temperature recording and a 24-hour alert system in place that allows for rapid response in case of
freezer or refrigerator malfunction. There must be an available backup freezer or refrigerator. The
freezers or refrigerators must be connected to a backup generator. In addition, vaccine
accountability study staff (eg, the unblinded personnel) are required to keep a temperature log to
establish a record of compliance with these storage conditions. The site is responsible for reporting
any mRNA-1273 that was not temperature controlled during shipment or during storage to the
unblinded site monitor. Such mRNA-1273 will be retained for inspection by the unblinded monitor
and disposed of according to approved methods.
The 0.9% sodium chloride injection (USP) should be stored at 20ºC to 25ºC (68ºF to 77ºF) in a
restricted access area (applicable to Part A only).
6.2.6.
Investigational Product Accountability
It is the investigator’s responsibility that the unblinded personnel maintain accurate records in an
IP accountability log of receipt of all IP, inventory at the site, dispensing of mRNA-1273 and
placebo, IP injections, and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used/unused products.
An unblinded site monitor will review the inventory and accountability log during site visits and
at the completion of the study. Additional details are found in the mRNA-1273-P301 Pharmacy
Manual.
6.2.7.
Handling and Disposal
An unblinded site monitor will reconcile the IP during the conduct and at the end of the study for
compliance. Once fully reconciled at the site at the end of the study, the IP can be destroyed at the
investigational site or at a Sponsor-selected third party, as appropriate.
Investigational product may be destroyed at the study site only if permitted by local regulations
and authorized by the Sponsor. A Certificate of Destruction must be completed and sent to the
Sponsor or designee.

Unblinding
6.2.8.1.
Planned Unblinding
See Section 4.1.2 regarding the PDV.
Part A, the Blinded Phase of this study is observer-blind. The investigator, study staff, study
participants, site monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to the IP
administered, with the following exceptions:
•
Unblinded personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to vaccine accountability
procedures and will prepare IP for all participants. These personnel will have no study
functions
other
than
study
vaccine
management,
documentation,
accountability,
preparation, and administration. They will not be involved in participant evaluations and
will not reveal the identity of IP to either the participant or the blinded study site personnel
involved in the conduct of the study unless this information is necessary in the case of an
emergency.
•
Unblinded medically qualified study site personnel will administer the IP. They will not be
involved in assessments of any study endpoints.
•
The dosing assignment will be concealed by having the unblinded personnel prepare the
IP in a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other study staff. An opaque sleeve
over the syringe used for injection will maintain the blind at the time of injection, as the
doses containing mRNA-1273 will look different than placebo. Only delegated unblinded
site staff will conduct the injection procedure. Once the injection is completed, only the
blinded study staff will perform further assessments and interact with the participants.
Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled at the pharmacy.
•
Unblinded site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be assigned as
the IP accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure that sites are
following all proper IP accountability, preparation, and administration procedures.
•
An unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the pre-planned IAs
(Section 9.6).
•
An independent DSMB will review the interim data to safeguard the interests of clinical
study participants and to help ensure the integrity of the study. The DSMB will review
unblinded statistical outputs and IA results, provided by the independent unblinded
statistician, and make recommendations to the Sponsor (Section 8.4.2).

•
At the initiation of Part B, the Open-Label Observational Phase of this study
(Section 4.1.3), study site personnel who were blinded during the Blinded Phase will be
unblinded at the participant level at the PDV.
•
If prespecified criteria for early efficacy are met by an IA or if the primary efficacy analysis
is completed based on accrual of prespecified COVID-19 cases, pre-identified Sponsor and
contract research organization (CRO) team members responsible for the analysis and
reporting will be unblinded to treatment assignments in order to prepare a final study report.
In order to maintain an observer-blind design, investigators, site staff, participants, and
Sponsor and CRO staff with oversight of study conduct will remain blinded to treatment
allocation for the study duration. All study participants will be followed for efficacy and
safety endpoints through the remainder of planned study period and results will be
summarized in an end of study report (Sections 4.1 and 9.1).
6.2.8.2.
Unplanned Unblinding
A participant or participants may be unblinded in the event of an SAE or other severe event, or if
there is a medical emergency requiring the identity of the product to be known to properly treat a
participant. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant during the study, the study
investigator may request that the blind will be broken if knowledge of the administered vaccine
will affect that participant’s dosing options. In this situation or in the event of a medical emergency
requiring identification of the IP administered to an individual participant, the investigator will
make every attempt to contact the Sponsor medical lead to explain the need for opening the code
within 24 hours of opening the code. The investigator will be responsible for documenting the
time, date, reason for the code break, and the names of the personnel involved.
In addition to the situations described above where the blind may be broken, the data will also be
unblinded to a statistical team at specified timepoints for IAs as outlined in Section 9.6.
In December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines started to become available under EUA as an alternative
option to some participants based on evolving recommended populations by the CDC and local
supply chain distribution. While all participants should be encouraged to stay blinded in the study
for as long as possible, their participation should not otherwise deny them the opportunity to
receive a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA. Clinical investigators can exercise discretion as to
whether individual participants should be unblinded upon request to allow them to make an
informed decision regarding receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine outside of this study. Investigator
judgment should consider a participant’s risk status under CDC recommendations, any current
local public health guidance, and their access to imminently receive a COVID-19 vaccine under
an EUA.

If a decision is made to unblind a participant to support an informed decision to receive a
COVID-19 vaccine under an EUA outside of this study, investigators are asked to take the
following steps:
•
Obtain a final assessment of safety from the participant to collect and resolve any
outstanding safety experience. Verbal interview is sufficient.
•
Unblind the participant in the IRT and inform the participant of their treatment
assignment.
•
Inform the Sponsor Medical Lead within 24 hours to confirm rationale for unblinding.
Participants who are confirmed to have received placebo upon unblinding and intend to receive a
COVID-19 vaccine under an EUA outside of this study will be withdrawn from the study at the
point of unblinding (Section 7.3.1).
Note: Participants who requested unblinding because of a stated imminent access to a COVID-19
vaccine under an EUA outside of this study, were withdrawn from study, and then were unable to
in fact receive a COVID-19 vaccine, will be permitted to re-enter this study upon re-consent to
receive the mRNA-1273 vaccine once they are eligible (as long as investigational vaccine is
available).
6.3.
Study Treatment Compliance
All doses of IP will be administered at the study site under direct observation of unblinded
medically qualified study personnel and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF.
Unblinded personnel will confirm that the participant has received the entire dose of vaccine. If a
participant does not receive vaccine or does not receive all of the planned doses, the reason for the
missed dose will be recorded. Data will be reconciled with site accountability records to assess
compliance.
Participants who miss the second dose of IP due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and not
due to a safety pause will still be required to follow the original visit and testing schedule as
described in the protocol. Except for participants who withdraw consent or who are withdrawn
from the study due to receipt of non-study COVID-19 primary series or first booster vaccine
(Section 7.3.1), a participant who withdraws or is withheld from receiving the second dose of study
vaccine in Part A or Part B will remain in the study and complete all efficacy, safety, and
immunogenicity assessments required through the participant’s scheduled end of study.
The study site is responsible for ensuring that participants comply with the study windows allowed.
If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact the participant and complete
a visit within the defined visit window (SoE Tables, Section 11.1). If a participant does not
complete a visit within the time window, that visit will be classified as a missed visit (with the

exception of Dose 2 visits in Part A and Part B, as applicable) and the participant will continue
with subsequent scheduled study visits. All safety requirements of the missed visit will be captured
and included in the subsequent visit (eg, clinical laboratory testing, eDiary review for
reactogenicity, immunologic testing, as applicable).

Prior and Concomitant Therapy
6.4.1.
Prior Medications and Therapies
Information about prior medications (including any prescription or over-the-counter medications,
vaccines, or blood products) taken by the participant within the 28 days before providing informed
consent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be recorded in the
participant’s eCRF.
6.4.2.
Concomitant Medications and Therapies
Study site staff must question the participant regarding any medications taken and vaccinations
received by the participant and record the following information in the eCRF:
•
All non-study vaccinations administered within the period starting 28 days before the first
dose of IP.
•
Seasonal influenza vaccine administered for the current influenza season (typically
October through April in the Northern Hemisphere).
•
All concomitant medications and non-study vaccinations taken through 28 days after
each dose of IP. Antipyretics and analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the
absence of any symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as
such.
•
Any concomitant medications used to prevent or treat COVID-19.
•
Any concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or an MAAE.
•
Part A: Participant will be asked in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or
analgesic to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7 days after each IP injection, including
the day of dosing. Reported antipyretic or analgesic medications should be recorded in
the source document by the site staff during the post-injection study visits or via other
participant interactions (eg, phone calls).

Concomitant Medications and Vaccines That May Lead to the Elimination of a
Participant From Per-protocol Analyses
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of
the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s eligibility to receive a second dose
or evaluability in the per-protocol (PP) analysis (Analysis Sets are described in Section 9.4):
•
Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study
vaccine used during the study period.
•
A non-study vaccine administered during the period from 28 days before through 28 days
after each dose of IP or any seasonal influenza vaccine that was administered within
14 days before or after any dose of IP.
•
Immunoglobulins and/or any blood products administered during the study period (except
for treatment of COVID-19).
•
Medications that suppress the immune system (except for treatment of COVID-19).
In addition, any participant confirmed to have received or plans to receive a non-study
COVID-19 vaccine, either licensed or under EUA, may also not be included in the PP analysis
(and may also be withdrawn from the study per Section 7.3.1 if non-study COVID-19 vaccine is
primary series or first booster).
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor
will make a joint decision about continuing or withholding further dosing from the participant
based
on
the
time
the
medication
was
administered,
the
drug’s
pharmacology
and
pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication will compromise the participant’s safety or
the interpretation of data. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that details regarding the
concomitant medications are adequately recorded in the eCRF.
All medication and interventions necessary for the appropriate care for the study participant,
particularly to treat COVID-19, should be administered and appropriately documented along with
the AE.

DELAYING OR DISCONTINUING STUDY TREATMENT AND
PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY
7.1.
Criteria for Delay of Study Treatment
Body temperature must be measured at the Day 1, Day 29, OL-D1, OL-D29, and BD-1 visits prior
to any study treatment administration.
The following events constitute criteria for delay of study treatment, and if any of these events
occur at the time scheduled for dosing, the participant may be injected at a later date within the
time window specified in Table 16, Table 21, Table 22, and Table 23, or the participant may be
discontinued from dosing at the discretion of the investigator (Section 7.2):
•
Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing.
•
Fever, defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C (100.4°F) at the time of dosing.
•
Part B only: Diagnosed COVID-19 by detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and
accompanying symptoms. Participant must be asymptomatic at the time of dosing,
although they may still be RT-PCR positive, with the exception of fatigue and loss of
sense of smell or taste, if by the investigator’s judgement these are deemed to be mild
chronic sequelae.
•
Part C only: Seasonal influenza vaccine that was administered within 14 days of the
BD-1 visit.
•
Part C only: Diagnosed COVID-19 by detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and
accompanying symptoms after completion of the primary vaccination series in Part A or
Part B. For all study participants who were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection after
Dose 1 and Dose 2 of mRNA-1273 but before the booster, the BD-1 visit should be
delayed for 90 days from the receipt of monoclonal Ab (mAb) or convalescent plasma
(CP) if given as a part of treatment per CDC recommendations. For participants who did
not receive mAb or CP, BD can be administered after a minimum of 30 days from the
onset of COVID-19 symptoms and complete resolution of the acute illness (except
fatigue and loss of sense of smell or taste). A delay of 90 days may be considered, if
feasible. If these criteria delay the BD-1 visit date beyond the allowable window per the
study timeline, the subject may not receive the dose as a part of the study.
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by the investigator, can be administered
IP. Participants with a fever of 38.0°C (100.4°F) or higher will be contacted within the time
window acceptable for participation and reevaluated for eligibility. If the investigator determines
that the participant’s health on the day of administration temporarily precludes dosing with IP, the
visit should be rescheduled within the allowed interval for that visit.

7.2.
Discontinuation of Study Treatment
Every reasonable attempt will be made to follow up with participants for safety throughout the
entire study period, even if further dosing is discontinued or the participant misses one or more
visits. Except for participants who withdraw consent or who are withdrawn from the study due to
receipt of non-study COVID-19 primary series or first booster vaccine (Section 7.3.1), a
participant who withdraws or is withheld from receiving the second dose of study vaccine in Part
A or Part B will be considered to have discontinued treatment but will remain in the study and
complete all scheduled visits and assessments (Section 11.1). Except for participants who
withdraw consent or who are withdrawn from the study due to receipt of non-study COVID-19
primary series or first booster vaccine (Section 7.3.1), a participant who does not receive the BD
in Part C will NOT be considered to have discontinued treatment and will remain in the study and
complete all scheduled visits and assessments.
The investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, may withhold a participant
from further dosing if the participant experiences any of the following:
•
Becomes pregnant (Section 8.3.6)
•
Develops, during the course of the study, symptoms or conditions listed in the exclusion
criteria
•
Experiences an AE (other than reactogenicity) after dosing that is considered by the
investigator to be related to IP (Section 8.3.10) and is of Grade 3 (severe) or greater
intensity (Section 8.3.9)
•
Experiences an AE or SAE that, in the judgment of the investigator, requires study IP
withdrawal due to its nature, severity, or required treatment, regardless of the causal
relationship to vaccine
•
Experiences a clinically abnormal vital sign measurement or finding on physical
examination, or general condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, requires IP
withdrawal
The reason(s) for discontinuation from further dosing will be recorded in the eCRF.
Prior to receiving a second dose of study vaccine in Part A or Part B and prior to receiving a BD
in Part C (as applicable), participants will be reassessed to ensure that they continue to meet
eligibility requirements as outlined below.
The following events in a participant constitute absolute contraindications to any further dosing of
the IP to that participant. If any of these events occur during the study, the participant must not
receive additional doses of vaccine but will be encouraged to continue study participation for safety
through end-of-study period as defined in Section 4.4.

Day 29, further administration of IP must be withheld until COVID-19 test results are
available.
•
Anaphylaxis or systemic hypersensitivity reaction following the administration of

7.3.
Participant Withdrawal From the Study
7.3.1.
Participant Withdrawal
Participants who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. A “withdrawal” from the study
refers to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the final visit planned in the protocol.
The statistical management of participant withdrawals is discussed in Section 9.
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason,
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The investigator will
request that the study participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.
A participant who withdraws consent or who is withdrawn from the study may request destruction
of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study
records. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent (see
Section 11.2.10).
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research results that have already been collected
for the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. All
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date
(or as permitted by local regulations).
If participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the investigator will try to
obtain agreement to follow up with the participant until the event is considered resolved or stable
and will then complete the end of study eCRF.
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will
document whether the decision to withdraw a participant from the study was made by the
participant or by the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was
responsible for withdrawal:

Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs) must be clearly
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will follow up
with participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an SAE or AE until resolution of
the event.
Participants who are confirmed to have received placebo upon unblinding and intend to receive a
COVID-19 vaccine either licensed or under an EUA outside of this study will be withdrawn from
the study. In addition, any participant confirmed to have received or plans to receive a non-study
COVID-19 vaccine for their primary series or first booster only, either licensed or under EUA,
will be withdrawn from the study. If a participant has an ongoing AE or pregnancy at the time of
receipt of a non-study COVID-19 primary series or first booster vaccine, the participant will
remain in the study to allow follow-up until the resolution of the event. Participants receiving a
second or subsequent non-study COVID-19 boosters will remain in the study and follow all study
procedures.
7.4.
Lost to Follow-up
Participants will be considered LTFU if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled visits without
stating an intention to withdraw consent and they cannot be contacted by the study site. The
following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study
visit:
•
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as
possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit
schedule, and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the
study.

•
Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the investigator or designee must make every
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local
equivalent methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls and registered
letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record. A participant should
not be considered LTFU until these efforts have been made.
•
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have
withdrawn from the study.

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants will sign an ICF (as detailed in
Section 11.2.6). Participants will undergo study procedures at the timepoints specified in the SoEs
(Section 11.1).
A participant also can be seen for an unscheduled visit at any time during the study. An
unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, Illness Visit criteria for COVID-19,
or new or ongoing AEs. The site also has the discretion to make reminder phone calls or send text
messages to inform the participant about visits, review eDiary requirements, or follow-up on
ongoing or outstanding issues.
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the
COVID-19 Pandemic” (DHHS 2020a), investigators may convert study site visits to telemedicine
visits with the approval of the Sponsor. Such action should be taken to protect the safety and
well-being of study participants and study site staff or to comply with state or municipal mandates.
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:
•
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their timing
must be followed as presented in Section 11.1. Adherence to the study design
requirements is essential and required for study conduct.
•
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue study treatment
or participation in the study.
•
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for
screening failure, as applicable.
•
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood
count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed
within the time frame defined in the SoE.

Efficacy and Immunogenicity Assessments and Procedures
8.1.1.
Efficacy Assessments Related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 Infection
Each study participant will have an NP swab sample collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing by
RT-PCR on Day 1 and Day 29, prior to receiving a dose of the IP as specified in the SoE
(Section 11.1).
COVID-19:
To be considered as a case of COVID-19 for the evaluation of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint, the
following criteria must be met:
o
The participant must have experienced at least TWO of the following systemic
symptoms: fever (≥38ºC), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory
and taste disorder(s), OR
o
The participant must have experienced at least ONE of the following respiratory
signs/symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, OR clinical or
radiographical evidence of pneumonia; AND
o
The participant must have at least 1 NP swab or saliva sample (or respiratory
sample, if hospitalized) positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
Severe COVID-19:
To be considered severe COVID-19, the following criteria must be met:
•
Confirmed case of COVID-19 as per the Primary Efficacy Endpoint case definition, plus
any of the following:
o
Clinical signs indicative of severe systemic illness, respiratory rate ≥30 per
minute, heart rate ≥125 beats per minute, SpO2 ≤93% on room air at sea level or
PaO2/FIO2 < 300 mmHg, OR
o
Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (defined as needing
high-flow oxygen, non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation), evidence of shock (systolic blood pressure [BP]
< 90 mmHg, diastolic BP < 60 mmHg or requiring vasopressors), OR
o
Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction, OR
o
Admission to an intensive care unit or death.
The secondary case definition of COVID-19 is defined as having any of the following systemic
symptoms: fever (temperature ≥38ºC), or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle aches, or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, nasal

congestion or rhinorrhea, nausea, or vomiting or diarrhea, AND a positive NP swab or saliva
sample (or respiratory sample, if hospitalized) for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
Death attributed to COVID-19 is defined as any participant who dies during the study with a cause
directly attributed to a complication of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 Infection:
•
SARS-CoV-2 infection is defined by seroconversion due to infection measured by bAb
against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. Seroconversion is defined as follows for participants
who are seronegative at Baseline:
o
Binding antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid either below the limit
of detection (LOD) or lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at Study Day 1 that
increase to above or equal to LOD or LLOQ starting at Study Day 57 or later.
8.1.2.
Surveillance for COVID-19 Symptoms
Surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms will be conducted by a combination of safety phone calls
and eDiary completion as presented in the SoEs in Section 11.1, in addition to study site visits
(Figure 3). If there is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2 days, the site staff will contact the
study participant by phone.
According to the CDC as of 10 Jun 2020 (CDC 2020c), patients with COVID-19 have reported a
wide range of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Throughout the study, to
surveil for COVID-19, the following prespecified symptoms that meet the criteria for suspicion of
COVID-19 will be elicited weekly from the participant and the presence of any one of these
symptoms lasting at least 48 hours (except for fever and/or respiratory symptoms) will result in
the site arranging an Illness Visit to collect an NP swab sample within 72 hours:
•
Fever (temperature ≥38ºC) or chills (of any duration, including ≤48 hours)
•
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including ≤48 hours)
•
Cough (of any duration, including ≤48 hours)
•
Fatigue
•
Muscle or body aches
•
Headache
•
New loss of taste or smell
•

It is important to note that some of the symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with solicited systemic
ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and
chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common,
investigators should use their clinical judgement to decide if an NP swab sample should be
collected (Part A). The collection of an NP swab sample prior to the Day 1 and Day 29 vaccination
can help ensure that cases of COVID-19 are not overlooked. Any study participant reporting
respiratory symptoms during the 7-day period after vaccination should be evaluated for
COVID-19.

Surveillance for COVID-19 Symptoms and the Corresponding Clinical Data
Pathways
During the course of the study, participants with symptoms of COVID-19 will be asked to return
within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site or medically qualified staff from the study
site will conduct a home visit as soon as possible to collect an NP swab sample (for RT-PCR),
collect a blood sample for immunologic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to evaluate for
COVID-19. Both study site visits and home visits are referred to as Illness Visits. An additional
NP swab sample will be collected and tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens.
In addition, the study site may collect an additional (non-study/local) respiratory sample for
SARS-CoV-2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical care for the study participant as
determined by local standards of care. If neither a study site visit or home visit is possible,

participants will be sent a saliva kit via courier or other Sponsor-approved method. The study site
will arrange to retrieve a saliva sample by local courier or other Sponsor-approved method, and
the sample will be tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. If participants are confirmed to have
SARS-CoV-2 infection, the investigator will notify the participant, and the participant’s primary
care physician, of the diagnosis. If the study participant does not have a primary care physician,
the investigator will assist them to obtain one. The participant will also be instructed on infection
prevention measures consistent with local public health guidance.
If scheduled, a study site Illness Visit includes assessments such as medical history, physical
examination, blood sampling for clinical laboratory testing, and 2 NP swabs, 1 for viral polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing and 1 for multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses,
to evaluate the severity of the clinical case. Radiologic imaging studies may be conducted. Blood
samples will be collected for potential future immunologic assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Every effort to complete an Illness Visit that includes both the NP swabs and blood draw should
be made by the site, even in the presence of a local positive or negative Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified or CLIA-certified waiver laboratory result for the
participant.
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria based both on symptoms for COVID-19
and on RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from samples collected within 72 hours of the study
participant reporting symptoms meeting the definition of COVID-19. Participants who are
hospitalized for COVID-19 without the opportunity for a clinic or home visit will also be
considered cases, assuming that the symptomatology criteria for COVID-19 are met and a
respiratory sample is positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR at a CLIA-certified or CLIA-certified
waiver laboratory. Investigators are encouraged to try to obtain a respiratory sample during the
course of hospitalization for submission to the study central laboratory, if feasible. The investigator
should determine if the criteria for severe COVID-19 has been met.
Evidence of severe COVID-19 is defined as in Section 8.1.1.
All clinical findings will be recorded in the eCRF. All confirmed cases of COVID-19 will be
captured as MAAEs, along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity,
seriousness, and outcome.
8.1.3.
Convalescent Period Starting With the Illness Visit
All study participants who experience COVID-19 symptoms and subsequently present for an
Illness Visit (in-clinic or at home) will be given an instruction card listing symptoms and severity
grading system, a thermometer, an oxygen saturation monitor, and saliva collection tubes.
Participants will be trained on the use of the oxygen saturation monitor and how to take saliva

Abbreviation: COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019.
The initial Illness Visit is considered Day 1 for the Convalescent Period. Starting on Day 2 of the
Convalescent Period, the investigator (or medically qualified staff appropriately delegated by the
investigator) will contact participants daily with telemedicine visits through Day 14 (from the
Illness Visit or initial COVID-19 contact) or until symptoms have resolved, whichever is later, and
which may include symptoms persisting longer than the 28-day Convalescent Period (with the
exception of mild loss of sense of taste/smell).
If a participant is completely asymptomatic for 72 hours prior to Day 14, including normal oxygen
saturation and temperature, then telemedicine calls can be reduced to weekly; however, the
participant should still report the daily symptoms at that contact. The participant should also report
their oxygen saturation and temperature measured on the day of the contact, but these need not be
recorded daily during this reduced frequency monitoring period. If a participant reports a change
or recurrence of symptoms, daily telemedicine visits should be resumed to the daily schedule. For
these participants, a final telemedicine visit will occur on Day 14 to determine before symptom
monitoring can be discontinued.
If the symptoms persist after Day 60, then telemedicine calls can be reduced to weekly; however,
the participant should still report the daily sypmptoms at that contact.
Telemedicine visits may be conducted by videoconference or by audio only (telephone). During
the telemedicine visit (preferably done in the evening), the participant will be asked to verbally
report the severity of each symptom and their highest body temperature and lowest oxygen
saturation for that day, and the investigator will determine if medical attention is required due to

worsening of COVID-19 symptoms. The presence and severity of each symptom reported by the
participant will be noted in the appropriate source document (Table 19).
During the telemedicine visits, participants will be reminded both to collect their own saliva
sample on 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, and 21 days after the initial Illness Visit and to return the sample to the
study site. Immediately upon receipt of a saliva sample, the study site will send it for testing to the
study central virology laboratory.
During the telemedicine visits, if the participant has a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 from the
Day 1 Illness Visit, the participant will continue the Convalescent Period. If the participant has a
negative result for SARS-CoV-2 from the Day 1 Illness Visit, the participant will exit the
Convalescent Period, including discontinuation of daily telemedicine visits and collection of saliva
samples, and will return to their respective study schedule (Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, or
Table 23). Participants who are pending a central laboratory PCR may exit from the Convalescent
Period based on a negative PCR result from a CLIA-certified or CLIA-certified waiver local
laboratory, at the investigator’s discretion. However, if the central laboratory PCR results are
positive after exit from the Convalescent Period, the Convalescent Period must resume.
All participants confirmed to be COVID-19 cases will be scheduled for a Convalescent Visit (study
site or home visit) 28 days after the initial Illness Visit. At this visit, a saliva sample will be
collected and a blood sample will be drawn for immunologic assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Table 19).
If the participant is hospitalized, medically qualified site personnel will try to obtain medical
records and SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic results and document if the criteria for COVID-19 or severe
COVID-19 have been met. If the participant is later discharged from the hospital during the 28-day
period following diagnosis of COVID-19, the study site personnel will arrange for a resumption
of a schedule for telemedicine visits and sampling for the remainder of the Convalescent Period,
followed by a return to their respective study schedule (Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, or Table 23).
8.1.4.
Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use
Study sites will distribute Sponsor-provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by participants
in assessing body temperature and injection site reactions for recording solicited ARs in eDiaries
(Section 8.2.2). Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to those participants
who do not have their own device to use for eDiary activities.
Participants will also receive the following Sponsor-provided supplies at Illness Visits where
COVID-19 is suspected:
•
An instruction card listing symptoms and severity grading system
•
A pulse oximeter for measuring oxygen saturation

•
Saliva collection tubes and instructions/means for returning saliva samples collected at
home to the study site
•
Additional oral thermometer, if required.
8.1.5.
Immunogenicity Assessments
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the timepoints indicated in the
SoEs (Section 11.1) and in Table 4. Blood samples for immunogenicity assessment will be
collected before administration of IP. The following analytes will be measured:
•
Serum bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 as measured by ligand-binding assay specific to
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
•
Serum bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 as measured by ligand-binding assay specific to
the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein
•
Serum nAb titer against SARS-CoV-2 as measured by pseudovirus and/or live virus
neutralization assays
Serum will be tested using the ligand-binding assay specific to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid to
determine the immunologic status of study participants at baseline and assess for seroconversion
due to infection during the course of the study. Serum from a subset of participants will be tested
in the other assays. The selection of the subset and timepoints to be tested will be described in the
statistical analysis plan (SAP). Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are
available and that adequate vial volumes may allow for further testing. The actual time and date
of each sample collected will be recorded in the eCRF, and unique sample identification will be
used to maintain the blind at the laboratory at all times and to allow for automated sample tracking
and storage. Handling and preparation of the samples for analysis, as well as shipping and storage
requirements, will be provided in a separate study manual.
The ligand-binding assay and measurement of nAb titers will be performed in laboratories
designated by the Sponsor.
8.2.
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant:
•
Solicited local and systemic ARs (Section 8.3.5) that occur during the 7 days following
each injection (ie, the day of dosing and 6 subsequent days). Solicited ARs will be
recorded daily using eDiaries (Section 8.2.2) (Part A).
•
Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28 days following each injection (ie, the
day of injection and 27 subsequent days) (Part A [all participants] and Part C [only those

who receive the BD]). Unsolicited AEs are AEs that are not included in the
protocol-defined solicited ARs (Section 8.3.5).
•
AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation from Day 1
through Day 759 or withdrawal from the study.
•
MAAEs from Day 1 through Day 759 or withdrawal from the study.
•
SAEs from Day 1 through Day 759 or withdrawal from the study.
•
AEs of special interest (AESIs; for participants who receive the BD in Part C) from
BD-Day 1 through Day 759 or withdrawal from the study.
•
Abnormal vital sign measurements.
•
Physical examination findings.
•
Pregnancy and accompanying outcomes.
•
Concomitant medications and non-study vaccinations.
8.2.1.
Safety Phone Calls
A safety phone call is a telephone call made to the participant by medically qualified study staff.
Medically qualified staff are those appropriately delegated individuals who are permitted to elicit
verbal medical history from participants based on local regulations and local licensing
requirements.
This call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information.
The participant will be interviewed according to the script about occurrence of unsolicited AEs,
MAAEs, SAEs, or AEs leading to study withdrawal and concomitant medications associated with
those events, receipt of any non-study vaccinations, and pregnancy. Occurrence of AEs will only
be collected by safety phone call during the Vaccination Phase (Table 16, Table 21, and Table 23).
The timing of the safety phone calls and the relevant safety information collected is provided in
the SoEs (Section 11.1).
All safety information described by the participant must be documented in source documents and
not documented on the script used for the safety telephone contact. All AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, and
AEs leading to study withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF as specified in Section 8.3.7.
8.2.2.
Use of Electronic Diaries
In Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, at the time of consent, the participants must confirm
they will be willing to complete an eDiary (for 7-day reactogenicity and to surveil weekly for
COVID-19 symptoms) using either an application downloaded to their smartphone or using a

device that is provided at the time of enrollment. This study will utilize the Medidata Patient Cloud
Application as the eDiary for both collection of 7-day reactogenicity and weekly eDiary prompts
to elicit an unscheduled Illness Visit if the participant is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. This
application allows for real-time data collection on a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant system directly
from participants.
In Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, before enrollment on Day 1, the participant will be
instructed to download the eDiary application on their personal smartphone or will be provided a
Sponsor-provisioned device to record solicited ARs (Section 8.3.5) and also to be utilized for
eDiary prompts through the COVID-19 surveillance period.
In Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, at each dosing visit, participants will record data into
the eDiary starting approximately 30 minutes after dosing under supervision of the study site staff
to ensure successful entry of assessments. The 30-minute assessment is an opportunity for site staff
to train the participant. The site staff will perform any retraining as necessary. Study participants
will continue to record data in an eDiary after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening
and at the same time each day, on the day of dosing and for 6 days following dosing.
In Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, the following local ARs will be solicited by the eDiary:
pain at injection site, erythema (redness) at injection site, swelling/induration (hardness) at
injection site, and localized axillary swelling or tenderness ipsilateral to the injection arm. The
following systemic ARs will be solicited by the eDiary: headache, fatigue, myalgia (muscle aches
all over the body), arthralgia (aching in several joints), nausea/vomiting, body temperature
(potentially fever), and chills.
In Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as
defined in Section 8.3.5, will be collected on the day of each IP injection and during the 7 days
after IP injection (ie, the day of dosing and 6 subsequent days). Any solicited AR that is ongoing
beyond Day 7 will be reported in an eDiary until resolution. Adverse reactions recorded in diaries
beyond Day 7 should be reviewed by study site staff either during the next scheduled phone call
or at the next study site visit (Table 16).
If eDiary prompts result in identification of relevant safety events according to the study period or
symptoms of COVID-19, a follow-up safety call will be triggered.
In Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, at each dosing visit, participants will be instructed or
reminded on thermometer usage to measure body temperature, ruler usage to measure injection
site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), and self-assessment for localized axillary
swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection arm.

In Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study, daily oral body temperature measurement should be
performed at approximately the same time each day using the thermometer provided by the study
site.
Surveillance for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 will start at Part A Day 1 and continue weekly
through the entire Surveillance Phase of the study (Table 17 and Table 18). After participants
complete Part A Vaccination Phase of the Study (Table 16 and Table 21), the weekly eDiary Safety
Follow-up prompts will be triggered on Day 61 (Table 17). The weekly eDiary prompts will utilize
the same Medidata Patient Cloud Application. Each week (ie, every 7 days) the participant will
receive a prompt on their smartphone device to regularly surveil for signs and symptoms of
COVID-19 and any other changes in health status. The participant will be trained on how to
complete the weekly eDiary prompts at the Part A Day 57 clinic visit and also reminded to call the
site immediately if they experience any COVID-19 symptoms. The weekly eDiary prompt will
inquire about the following:
•
Changes in health since the last time completing the weekly eDiary prompt or the last
contact with the study staff
•
Any known exposure to someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 since the last
time completing the weekly eDiary prompt or the last contact with the study staff
•
Capture of any COVID-19 symptoms currently being experienced or experienced since the
last time completing the weekly check-in as defined in Section 8.1.2
•
Any contact with a healthcare provider that may indicate an MAAE.
A positive response by the participant to these prompts will result in a notification to both the
participant and study staff to arrange a call. A follow-up safety call will be performed to the
participant to determine if an unscheduled Illness Visit for the participant should be arranged as
defined in Section 8.1.2. The results of the safety call should be recorded in the appropriate source
documentation.
If a participant does not respond to the weekly eDiary within a 2-day window around the scheduled
timepoint, study staff will follow up directly with the participant via phone call or text to confirm
their health status and to remind the participant of the importance of maintaining weekly contact
via the eDiary prompt.
In addition, there will be an eDiary prompt to solicit the collection of information regarding
participant’s history of facial injections or dermal fillers, for cosmetic or medical indications such
as migraine headaches.

Demographics/Medical History
Demographic information relating to the participant’s sex, age, and race will be recorded at
Screening on the appropriate eCRF page.
Additionally, information regarding participant occupational circumstances (eg, essential worker
status) will be collected at Screening.
Medical history of each participant, including risk factors for severe COVID-19 as defined in
Section 6.2.1.1, will be collected and recorded on the Medical History eCRF page. Significant
findings that were present prior to the signature of the informed consent will also be included in
the Medical History eCRF page.
Study participants will also be asked to report history of receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine
during the current influenza season (typically October through April in the Northern Hemisphere)
as a concomitant medication.
8.2.4.
Physical Examination
A full physical examination, including vital signs, height, and weight, will be performed at
Screening and on Day 1, and symptom-directed physical examinations at other scheduled
timepoints as indicated in the SoEs (Section 11.1). The full examination will include assessment
of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular, abdomen, lymph
nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities. Symptom-directed physical examinations may be
performed at other timepoints at the discretion of the investigator.
On each dosing day before injection, the arm receiving the injection should be examined and the
associated lymph nodes should be evaluated.
Body mass index will be calculated at the Screening Visit (Day 0).
Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit after the first dose should be
reported as an MAAE.
Significant new findings that begin or worsen after informed consent must be recorded on the AE
eCRF page.
8.2.5.
Vital Sign Measurements
Vital signs will be measured at the timepoints indicated in the SoEs (Section 11.1). The participant
will be seated for at least 5 minutes before all measurements are taken. On Day 1 and Day 29, vital
sign measurements will be collected once before IP injection and at least 30 minutes after IP
injection (before participants are discharged from the study site). When applicable, vital sign
measurements should be performed before blood collection.

Febrile participants at Day 1 and Day 29 visits (fever is defined as a body temperature
≥38.0°C/100.4°F) may be rescheduled within the relevant window periods. Criteria for delay of
study treatment are provided in Section 7.1. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses may be
injected at the discretion of the investigator.
If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical abnormalities
of Grade 3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade will be documented on the AE page of the
eCRF (unless there is another known cause of the abnormality that would result in an AE
classification). The investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additional
assessments until the vital sign value has reached the reference range, returns to the vital sign value
at baseline, is considered stable, or until the investigator determines that follow-up is no longer
medically necessary.
8.2.6.
Blood Sampling
The maximum planned volumes of blood sampled for immunogenicity analyses per participant are
approximately 50 mL for 1 day, 100 mL for 28 days (Table 16), and 300 to 420 mL (dependent on
participation in Part B and Part C) for the total study volume (Table 4).

Safety Definitions and Procedures
8.3.1.
Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans,
whether or not considered drug related.
A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to IP or any
event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure.
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition
•
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•
New conditions detected or diagnosed after the first dose of IP even though they may
have been present before the start of the study.
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition
•
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to
the procedure should be the AE.
•
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or
convenience admission to a hospital).
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the AE
(Section 8.3.5). For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable
possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the
AE.
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by the participant that is not specified as a solicited AR in
the protocol; or is specified as a solicited AR in the protocol, but starts outside the protocol-defined
period for reporting solicited ARs (ie, for the 7 days after each dose of IP, Part A, Blinded Phase
only).
8.3.2.
Medically Attended Adverse Events
An MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit (including a telemedicine visit) to a
healthcare practitioner (HCP). This would include visits to a study site for unscheduled
ModernaTX, Inc.

assessments (eg, rash assessment, abnormal laboratory follow-up, COVID-19 [Section 8.1.1]) and
visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary care physician). Investigators
will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAEs. All MAAEs must be fully reported
on the MAAE page of the eCRF.
8.3.2.1.
Anaphylaxis
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as an SAE, based
on criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As an
SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all circumstances
within 24 hours as per Section 8.3.12 (Reporting SAEs). The investigator will submit any updated
anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting purposes,
a participant who displays signs/symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis as shown below should be
reported as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as general guidance for investigators
and is based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition (Rüggeberg et al 2007).
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi-organ system involvement that can
present as, or rapidly progress to, a severe life-threatening reaction. It may occur following
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources. Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized
by:
•
Sudden onset AND
•
Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND
•
Involving 2 or more organ systems, as follows:
-
Skin/mucosal: urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes
-
Cardiovascular: measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompensated
shock, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, evidence of
reduced peripheral circulation
-
Respiratory: bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, upper
airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respiratory distress,
persistent dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, rhinorrhea
-
Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
8.3.3.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI is a serious or nonserious AE of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the investigator
to the Sponsor is required and documentation is in the form of a case narrative. Such events may
ModernaTX, Inc.

Page 102
require further investigation to characterize and understand them. Refer to Section 11.5 for a list
of AESIs pertinent to this study. All AESIs will be collected for participants receiving the BD in
Part C through the remaining study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or designee
immediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the
electronic data capture system. If a site receives a report of a new AESI from a study participant
or receives updated data on a previously reported AESI, and the eCRF has been taken offline, then
the site can report this information on a paper AESI form using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline,
or the SAE Fax line (Section 8.3.11).
Acute Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis
These definitions are intended to serve as a guide to help in the reporting of suspected cases of
myocarditis and/or pericarditis; however, the diagnosis of suspected cases is left to the
investigator’s clinical judgement.
All suspected cases of probable and confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis should
be recorded as an AESI, and reported as an SAE, if the event meets seriousness criteria. As an
SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all circumstances
within 24 hours as per Section 8.3.11. The investigator will submit any updated myocarditis,
pericarditis, or myopericarditis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. For
reporting purposes, a participant who displays signs/symptoms consistent with the CDC case
definitions as described below (Gargano et al 2021), should be reported as a potential case of
confirmed or probable myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis.
Acute Myocarditis Case Definition
Presence of ≥1 new or worsening of the following clinical symptoms (persons who lack the listed
symptoms but who meet other criteria may be classified as subclinical myocarditis [probable or
confirmed]):
•
Chest pain/pressure/discomfort
•
Dyspnea/shortness of breath/pain with breathing
•
Palpitations
•
Syncope
AND
For PROBABLE CASE:

▪
Paroxysmal or sustained atrial, supraventricular, or ventricular arrhythmias
▪
AV nodal conduction delays or intraventricular conduction defects
•
Abnormal cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram
•
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) finding consistent with myocarditis
(Ferreira et al 2018)
AND
•
No other identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings
For CONFIRMED CASE:
•
Histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis (using Dallas criteria [Aretz et al 1987])
OR
•
cMRI findings consistent with myocarditis in the presence of troponin level above
upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)
AND
•
No other identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings
Acute Pericarditis Case Definition
Presence of ≥2 new or worsening of the following clinical features (Adler et al 2015):
•
Acute chest pain (Typically described as pain made worse by lying down, deep
inspiration, or cough; and relieved by sitting up or leaning forward, although other
types of chest pain may occur)

Serious Adverse Events
An AE (including an AR) is considered an SAE if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor,
it results in any of the following outcomes:
•
Death
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the investigator
during the protocol-defined follow-up period must be reported to the Sponsor, whether or
not it is considered related to IP.
•
Is life-threatening
An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the investigator or the
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
•
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
In general, inpatient hospitalization indicates the participant was admitted to the hospital
or emergency ward for at least one overnight stay for observation and/or treatment that
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. The
hospital or emergency ward admission should be considered an SAE regardless of
whether opinions differ as to the necessity of the admission. Complications that occur
during inpatient hospitalization will be recorded as an AE; however, if a complication/AE
prolongs hospitalization or otherwise fulfills SAE criteria, the complication/AE will be
recorded as a separate SAE.
•
Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
normal life functions
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
•
Congenital anomaly or birth defect
•
Medically important event
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the
ModernaTX, Inc.

above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
8.3.5.
Solicited Adverse Reactions (Part A)
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms
(ARs) occurring after IP injection. The eDiary will solicit daily participant reporting of ARs using
a structured checklist (Section 8.2.2). Participants will record such occurrences in an eDiary on the
day of IP injection and for the 6 days after the day of dosing.
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the
eDiary according to the grading scales presented in Table 5 modified from the Toxicity Grading
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical
Trials (DHHS 2007).
If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond 7 days after dosing, the participant will be
prompted daily to capture solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until resolution. Adverse
reactions recorded in eDiaries beyond Day 7 should be reviewed by the investigator either via
phone call or at the following study visit. All solicited ARs (local and systemic) will be considered
causally related to dosing.

Any solicited AR that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into the
participant’s source document and must also be recorded as an AE in the participant’s
Adverse Event eCRF:
•
Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to an HCP (MAAE)
•
Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study or
the participant being withdrawn from the study by the investigator (AE leading to
withdrawal)
•
Solicited local or systemic AR lasting beyond 7 days post injection
•
Solicited local or systemic AR that leads to participant withdrawal from IP
•
Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE
8.3.6.
Recording and Follow-up of Pregnancy
Female participants who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening should not be enrolled;
participants who have a positive pregnancy test any time during the study should receive no further
dosing with IP but should be asked to remain in the study and be followed-up for safety. Pregnancy
testing is scheduled to occur at Screening, Blinded and OL Day 1, Blinded and OL Day 29, and
Part C BD-Day 1 (Table 16, Table 21, Table 22, and Table 23).
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment
and until Day 759.
•
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in this section.
•
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth,
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee
within 24 hours of the site learning of its occurrence. If the participant agrees to submit this
information, the pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or
voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects,
congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow-up should occur
even if intended duration of the safety follow-up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms
will be distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose. The investigator must immediately
(within 24 hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy resulting in an abnormal
outcome according to the procedures described for SAEs.

8.3.7.
Recording and Follow-up of an AE and/or SAE
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and
reported to the Sponsor.
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after each dose (Part A). Other
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after each dose in Part A (all
participants) and Part C (only those who receive the BD).
Both MAAEs and SAEs will be collected from Day 1 throughout the entire study duration
(Day 759 for all participants), as specified in the SoEs (Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, Table 19,
Table 21, Table 22, and Table 23). Any AEs occurring before receipt of IP will be analyzed
separately from TEAEs.
At every study site visit or telephone contact, participants will be asked a standard question to
elicit any medically related changes, including surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms, in their
well-being according to the scripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they have been
hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication
regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter medications), or had any non-study vaccinations.
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings or other documents relevant
to participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF.
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU
(as defined in Section 7.4).
8.3.8.
Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
All confirmed serious COVID-19 cases and SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or
designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in
Section 8.3.11. The investigator will submit any updated serious COVID-19 cases and SAE data
to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. COVID-19 cases are defined in Section 8.1.1.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study
participation (Day 759). However, if an investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any
time after a participant has been discharged from the study and considers the event to be reasonably
related to the study IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
8.3.9.
Assessment of Intensity
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as described
in the definition of an SAE (Section 8.3.4), NOT when it is rated as severe.

Page 110
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled
in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials (DHHS 2007) will be used to categorize local and systemic
reactogenicity events (solicited ARs), clinical laboratory test results, and vital sign measurements
observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity events are
presented in Section 8.3.55.
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by the investigator based
upon medical judgment and the definitions of severity as follows:
•
Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.
•
Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities
and require limited or no medical intervention.
•
Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive
therapeutic intervention.
Study staff should elicit from the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source
documentation. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s source
documentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be
performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset and duration of
each episode. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is reported once in
the eCRF at the highest severity observed.
8.3.10.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to IP is part of the documentation process
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the following
classification:
Not related: There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. Participant did not
receive the IP OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the IP is not
reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the IP.
Related: There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of exposure
to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the IP is
reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the IP than by another cause.

8.3.11.
Reporting Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the study,
regardless of their relationship to IP or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to whether
a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the
eCRF. Information to be collected includes, type of event, time of onset, investigator-specified
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and relationship to IP, time of
resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome.
The unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions
to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be
followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by the investigator to be not clinically
significant. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all
unsolicited AEs.
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened but does not
deteriorate should not be reported as an unsolicited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.
Any AE or COVID-19 case considered serious by the investigator or that meets SAE criteria
(Section 8.3.4) must be reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours of becoming aware
of the SAE or COVID-19 case). The investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the IP caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant
regulatory authorities of any SAE as outlined in the 21 US CFR Parts 312 and 320. The investigator
is responsible for notifying the institutional review board (IRB) directly.
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the following contact information is to be used
for SAE reporting:
•

Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations
and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention
under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The
ModernaTX, Inc.

Sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to
the regulatory authority, IRBs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious ARs according to
local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety
information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it along
with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.4.
Monitoring Committees
8.4.1.
Protocol Safety Review Team
A Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will be formed to review interim and cumulative blinded
(unblinded in Part C) safety data on a regular basis with a remit to escalate concerns to the DSMB
(DSMB limited to Part A only). The PSRT composition, its remit, and frequency of data review
will be further defined in a charter.
8.4.2.
Data and Safety Monitoring Board
An independent DSMB will periodically review blinded and unblinded data, including both safety
and cases of COVID-19 at scheduled data review meetings and at 2 planned IAs.
•
In addition to blinded and unblinded review of safety data, at each data review meeting the
DSMB will review the numbers and rate of COVID-19 cases, including rate of severe
COVID disease with prespecified thresholds for imbalance in the treatment groups which
would trigger halting rules.
•
At the IA, the DSMB will review the IA results and make recommendations to an Oversight
Group in terms of study results reporting and unblinding based on the boundaries of early
efficacy as described in Section 9.6 of the protocol. The Oversight Group will be comprised
of a voting member each from the Sponsor, Biomedical Advance Research and
Development Authority, and NIAID.
•
The DSMB will monitor the study for non-efficacy at the IA. The boundary for
non-efficacy is non-binding and will be provided in the DSMB analysis plan.
•
The DSMB will also monitor the study for vaccine harm based on severe COVID-19.
Continuous harm monitoring will be provided for COVID-19 and severe COVID-19
separately. For harm monitoring, cases will be counted starting after the first dose of study
vaccination. Boundaries will be provided based on the exact 1-sided binomial tests
conditional on the total number of cases under the assumption of VE=0%. If the
prespecified stopping boundary is reached for either COVID-19 or severe COVID-19, then

the unblinded statisticians will immediately inform the DSMB that the harm rules have
been met. Details will be provided in the DSMB analysis plan.
•
The boundaries are considered guidelines, ie, a recommendation to modify the study would
not be based solely on statistical rules, as many other factors (ie, totality of the data from
the study including additional efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity endpoints as well as
data external to the study) may be part of the decision process. In the case of a
recommendation to continue the trial regardless of crossing the boundaries for efficacy or
inefficacy, the reason for disregarding the boundary must be documented in the meeting
minutes and communicated to the Sponsor.
After each data review meeting or IA, the DSMB will make a recommendation to the Sponsor
through an Oversight Group to take one of the following courses of action:
•
Stop further enrollment due to meeting criteria for early efficacy or due to a safety concern.
•
Pause enrollment and consider a change in study design.
•
Continue enrollment and/or study conduct as planned.
The Sponsor may also request that the DSMB conduct ad hoc reviews of safety events from this
study or other data, including new nonclinical or clinical information related to mRNA-1273
external to this study. The DSMB will review all available study data to adjudicate such events in
accordance with the DSMB charter.
The DSMB composition, its remit, and frequency of data review will be further defined in the
DSMB charter and analysis plan.
8.4.3.
Adjudication Committee
An Adjudication Committee (AC) will be assembled for the purpose of reviewing potential cases
to determine if the criteria for the primary and secondary endpoints have been met. The AC will
remain blinded to treatment assignment when adjudicating cases for participants whose treatment
group is still blinded. The AC composition, its remit, and frequency of data review will be further
defined in a charter.
8.4.4.
Independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee
An independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee (CEAC) that includes pediatric and adult
cardiologists will review suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if they meet
CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” events, and to assess severity (Gargano et al 2021).
Any cases that the CEAC assesses as representing probable or confirmed cases of myocarditis or
pericarditis will be referred to the Sponsor, who will then make a final decision on whether to

suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing based on an assessment of the overall potential
risk to study participants.
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed
at the organizational meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition,
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.
8.5.
Management of Overdose
As the study treatment is to be administered by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely that an
overdose will occur. Dose deviations will be tracked as protocol deviations (Section 11.2.8).

Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.

Exploratory Assessments and Biomarkers
Exploratory assessments may include assessment of biomarkers for safety, reactogenicity,
inflammatory and cardiac function. Serologic markers of disease severity, immune response to
SARS-CoV-2, RT-PCR of NP swab or saliva samples, and genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2
strains isolated from participants’ samples may also be measured.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study,
focusing on the Blinded Phase of the study (Part A). The details of statistical analysis will be
provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before the clinical database lock for the study and
treatment unblinding. If, after the study has begun, but prior to any unblinding, changes are made
to primary and/or key secondary objectives/hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those
hypotheses, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with ICH Guideline E9). Changes to
other secondary or exploratory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, along with an
explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in the SAP or clinical study report
(CSR) for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, will be clearly identified in the CSR.
Statistical analysis strategy incorporating the Open-Label Observational Phase (Part B), and to
assess the BD of mRNA-1273 (Part C) will be provided in the SAP.
9.1.
Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses
Blinding during the Part A, the Blinded Phase of the study will be conducted as described in
Section 6.2.8. The Sponsor Biostatistics department or designee will generate the randomized
allocation schedule(s) for study treatment assignment. Randomization will be implemented via an
IRT.
Planned interim and primary analyses are described in Section 9.6. Participant-level unblinding
will be restricted to an independent unblinded statistician and, as needed, a statistical programmer
performing the IAs, who will have no other responsibilities associated with the study.
In addition to the routine study monitoring outlined in this protocol, an external DSMB will review
interim data to safeguard the interests of clinical study participants and to enhancing the integrity
of the study. The DSMB will review treatment-level results of the IAs, provided by the
independent unblinded statistician. Limited additional Sponsor personnel may be unblinded to the
treatment-level results of the IAs, if required, in order to act on the recommendations of the DSMB.
The extent to which individuals are unblinded with respect to results of IAs will be documented.
Depending on the recommendation of the DSMB, the Sponsor may prepare a regulatory
submission after an IA. In this case, pre-identified Sponsor members including the analysis and
reporting team will be unblinded to treatment assignments and remain unblinded for the remainder
of the study. Participants and investigators will remain blinded.
9.2.
Statistical Hypotheses
For the primary efficacy objective, the null hypothesis of this study is that the VE of mRNA-1273
to prevent first occurrence of COVID-19 is ≤30% (ie, H0efficacy: VE ≤0.3). The study will be
considered to meet the primary efficacy objective if the corresponding confidence interval (CI) of
VE rules out 30% at either one of the IAs or at the primary analysis.
ModernaTX, Inc.

Vaccine efficacy is defined as the percent reduction in the hazard of the primary endpoint
(mRNA-1273 vs. placebo). Equivalently, the null hypothesis is:
H0efficacy: hazard ratio (HR) ≥0.7 (equivalently, proportional hazards VE ≤0.3).
A stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment
group difference (ie, HR) between mRNA-1273 and placebo at a 1-sided 0.025 significance level.
The primary analysis population for efficacy will be the PP Set, defined in Section 9.4. In the
primary analysis of efficacy, cases will be counted starting 14 days after the second dose of IP.
Hypothesis testing for immunogenicity is described in Section 9.5.3.2.
9.3.
Sample Size Determination
The sample size is driven by the total number of cases to demonstrate VE (mRNA-1273 vs.
placebo) to prevent COVID-19 in Part A. Under the assumption of proportional hazards over time
and with 1:1 randomization of mRNA-1273 and placebo, a total of 151 COVID-19 cases will
provide 90% power to detect a 60% reduction in hazard rate (60% VE), rejecting the null
hypothesis H0: VE ≤30%, with 2 IAs at 35% and 70% of the target total number of cases using a
1-sided O’Brien-Fleming boundary for efficacy and a log-rank test statistic with a 1-sided false
positive error rate of 0.025. The total number of cases pertains to the PP Set accruing at least
14 days after the second dose. There are 2 planned IAs in this study, which will be performed when
approximately 35% and 70% of the target total number of cases have been observed.
Approximately 30,000 participants will be randomized with the following assumptions:
•
The target VE against COVID-19 is 60% (with 95% CI lower bound ruling out 30%,
rejecting the null hypothesis H0: VE ≤30%)
•
A 6-month COVID-19 incidence rate of 0.75% in the placebo arm
•
An annual dropout rate of 2% (loss of evaluable participants)
•
Two IAs at 35% and 70% of total target cases across the 2 treatment groups with
O’Brien-Fleming boundaries for efficacy monitoring
•
3-month uniform accrual
•
Approximately 15% of participants will be excluded from the PP population, and
participants are at risk for COVID-19 starting 14 days after the second dose
Table 6 provides sample size with 90% power to demonstrate VE on COVID-19.

The sample size is calculated using R package gsDesign (Anderson 2020).
Under these above assumptions including 6-month incidence rate of 0.75% on placebo, with
30,000 participants, it will take approximately 5, 8, and 10 months from study start (first subject
first dose), respectively, to accrue 35% (approximately 53), 70% (approximately 106) and 100%
(151) of the target number of cases in the PP Set.

Participants will be analyzed according to the group to which they
were randomized.
Modified Intent-to-Treat
(mITT) Set
All participants in the FAS who had no immunologic or virologic

Statistical Analyses
This section provides a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary
endpoints.
The overall Type I error rate for the primary endpoint at the IAs and the primary analysis is strictly
controlled at 2.5% (1-sided) based on the Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming approximation spending
function (see Section 9.6 for details). The primary efficacy results that will be considered
statistically significant after consideration of the strategy for controlling the Type I error as
described in Section 9.6. Statistical significance of the primary efficacy endpoint can be achieved
at either one of the IAs or at the primary analysis. A sequential/hierarchical testing procedure will
be used to control Type 1 error rate over the primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary efficacy
endpoints. Secondary efficacy endpoints will only be tested when the primary efficacy endpoint
achieves statistical significance. Multiplicity adjustments among the secondary efficacy endpoints
may be performed for secondary efficacy endpoints, in that case, will be specified in the SAP.
No formal multiple comparison adjustments will be employed for multiple safety endpoints or
multiple efficacy endpoints. Nominal p-values and CIs may be computed for other efficacy
analyses without controlling for multiplicity as a measure of VE.
9.5.1.
Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the FAS, mITT, and PP populations, and participants
will be included in the treatment group to which they were randomized. The primary analysis
population will be the PP Set.
Table 9 summarizes the analysis approach for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for
Part A, the randomized, observer-blind, and placebo-controlled phase of the study. Sensitivity
analysis methods are described for each endpoint as applicable.

Efficacy Analysis on Primary Endpoint
To assess the primary efficacy endpoint of VE of mRNA-1273 in preventing the first occurrence
of COVID-19 from 14 days after second dose of IP, Cox proportional hazards regression will be
used to estimate proportional hazards VE (PH VE), measured by one minus the HR (mRNA-1273
vs. placebo), with a 2-sided score-based 95% CI and 2-sided p-value for testing H0: VE ≤30%.
Vaccine efficacy is defined as the percent reduction in the hazard of the primary endpoint
(mRNA-1273 vs. placebo). The VE will be estimated using one minus the HR (mRNA-1273 vs.
placebo) estimand. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be used to assess the magnitude
of the treatment group difference (ie, HR) between mRNA-1273 and placebo. The HR and its 95%
CI from the stratified Cox model with Efron’s method of tie handling and with treatment group as
covariate will be reported. The same stratification factors used for randomization will be applied
to the stratified Cox model.
For the primary efficacy endpoints, participants without documented COVID-19 will be censored
at the last study assessment date. Potential intercurrent events may include: 1) death unrelated to
COVID-19 and 2) early COVID-19 up to 14 days after second study dose.
In the estimand of the primary analysis on the primary endpoint, a hypothetical strategy will be
used for death unrelated to COVID-19; a hypothetical strategy will also be used for early
COVID-19, where the time to COVID-19 will be censored at the onset day of early case. The
details of intercurrent event description and estimand strategies are presented in Section 11.4.1.
For the primary efficacy analysis, cases will be counted starting 14 days after the second
vaccination. Sensitivity analyses with cases counted immediately after the second vaccination, and
after randomization will also be carried out.
Analyses of the primary endpoint will be also performed based on the mITT Set using the same
methods described above.
For the primary efficacy analysis, cases will be counted starting 14 days after the second dose of
IP. Sensitivity analyses with cases counted starting immediately after the second dose of IP and
starting immediately after randomization will also be carried out.
Subgroup analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed in selected subgroups, such
as age groups ≥18 and < 65 year and ≥65 years to assess consistency of VE as described in
Section 9.5.5.
As a supportive analysis, VE will also be estimated by one minus the infection rate ratio, where
the number of cases (ie, participants with first occurrence of COVID-19) will be used and the CI
will be computed using the exact method conditional upon the total number of cases. Cumulative
incidence VE, one minus the ratio of cumulative incidences (mRNA-1273 vs. placebo) of

Efficacy Analysis on Secondary Endpoint
For each of the below secondary objectives:
•
Vaccine efficacy to prevent severe COVID-19
•
Vaccine efficacy to prevent serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19
regardless of symptomatology or severity
•
Vaccine efficacy to prevent COVID-19 using a broad definition of symptoms
•
Vaccine efficacy to prevent death caused by COVID-19
•
Vaccine efficacy to prevent asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection
For each of the above secondary objectives, the same Cox proportional hazard model described
above for the primary objective will be applied using the PP Set, with cases counted starting
14 days after the second dose of IP. Sensitivity analyses with cases counted starting after the
second dose of IP, 14 days after the first dose of IP, after the first dose of IP, and after
randomization will also be performed.
The same model will be applied using the mITT population with cases counted starting 14 days
after the second dose of IP.
Vaccine efficacy will be estimated with 1- ratio of incidence rates with the 95% CI using the exact
method conditional upon the total number of cases.
Vaccine efficacy to prevent COVID-19 after the first dose of IP
The same Cox proportional hazard model described above for the primary objective will be applied
using the PP Set, with cases counted starting 14 days after the first dose of IP.
Vaccine efficacy to prevent COVID-19 regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection
The FAS will be used for analysis to evaluate VE to prevent COVID-19 regardless of prior
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The same methods described above for the primary objective will be
applied with cases counted starting 14 days after the second dose of IP. Sensitivity analyses with
cases counted starting after the second dose of IP, 14 days after the first dose of IP, the first dose
of IP, and randomization will also be performed.

mRNA-1273 and placebo or starting 14 days after the second dose of mRNA-1273 for participants
in the Placebo-mRNA-1273 Cohort. Sensitivity analyses with cases starting from the second dose,
14 days after the first dose, or first dose of IP for participants in the cohorts of mRNA-1273 and
placebo, or mRNA-1273 for participants in the Placebo-mRNA-1273 Cohort may be provided.

Part C
In Part C, the immunogenicity analysis of BD vaccine response will be performed using the
noninferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses based on the 2 key secondary endpoints, respectively.
Further considerations for immunogenicity analyses are provided in the SAP.
Part C Key Secondary Endpoint 1: Ab GMT at BD-Day 29
Hypothesis: immunogenicity response to mRNA-1273 BD as measured by Ab GMT at BD-Day 29
in Part C is noninferior compared with Ab GMT at Day 57 (28 days after second dose) in the
primary series of mRNA-1273.
The noninferiority of post-booster GMT at BD-Day 29 in Part C as compared to the primary series
at Day 57 is considered to be demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR (ratio of
GMT at BD-Day 29 vs. GMT at Day 57 [28 days after Dose 2 of the primary series]) is ≥0.67
using a noninferiority margin of 1.5 (1.5-fold immuno-bridging margin for the lower bound of the
95% CI for GMT ratio/GMR).
The GMT with 95% CI will be summarized using t-distribution of the log transferred values and
then back transformed to the original scale. The GMR with 95% CI to compare post-booster GMT
at BD-Day 29 in Part C with the primary series GMT at Day 57 (28 days after the second dose)
will be computed based on the t-distribution of mean difference in the log transferred values and
then back transformed to the original scale.
Part C Key Secondary Endpoint 2: Ab Seroresponse Rate at BD-Day 29
Hypothesis: immunogenicity response to mRNA-1273 BD as measured by seroresponse rate
(SRR) at BD-Day 29 in Part C is noninferior compared with SRR of the primary series at Day 57
(28 days after second dose of the primary series of mRNA-1273).
The noninferiority in SRR post-booster at BD-Day 29 in Part C compared with SRR of the primary
series at Day 57 (28 days after the second dose of the primary series of mRNA-1273) is considered
to be demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR difference (SRR of the booster at
BD-Day 29 – SRR of the primary series at Day 57) is > –10% (using the noninferiority margin of
10%). The SRR difference is defined as the seroresponse rate at BD-Day 29 in Part C minus the
seroresponse rate at Day 57 (28 days after the second dose) following the primary series of
mRNA-1273. The seroresponse of a booster or the primary series is defined as a titer change from
baseline (pre-Dose 1 in primary series) below the LLOQ to ≥4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4-fold rise if
baseline is ≥LLOQ.
The SRR with 95% CI (using Clopper-Pearson method) will be provided. The SRR difference with

Day 57 (28 days after the second dose) will be computed. The method for computing 95% CI of
seroresponse rate difference will be provided in the SAP.
The primary immunogenicity objective in Part C is met if noninferiority is demonstrated based on
both key secondary endpoints (both GMT and SRR) .
9.5.4.
Exploratory Analyses in Part A
The endpoint of viral infection kinetics will be assessed by determining the number of days until
testing of saliva samples becomes negative after COVID-19 is established.
The endpoint of duration of symptoms will be assessed by determining the total number of days
that a study participant with COVID-19 remains symptomatic through daily assessments after
diagnosis.
Vaccine efficacy to prevent all-cause mortality will be assessed by similar analysis methods as
used for the primary endpoint analysis, using PP Set, mITT Set, and FAS. All deaths, regardless
of cause from the time of randomization, will be included. If the number of deaths becomes large
enough to warrant analysis, the same Cox proportional hazard model described above for the
primary objective will be applied using the PP Set, the mITT Set, and the FAS. Death, regardless
of cause, from randomization will be included.
This endpoint of burden of disease (BOD) is defined based on the post SARS-CoV-2 infection
follow-up. A BOD score will be used to reflect the severity of symptoms with maximum score at
COVID-19 death (Table 14).

Subgroup Analyses
To determine whether the VE is consistent across various subgroups, the VE and its 95% CI may
be estimated using the similar model within each category of the following classification variables.
•
Age groups: ≥18, < 65, and ≥65
•
Age and health risk for severe disease: ≥18 and < 65 and not at risk; ≥18 and < 65 and at
risk, and ≥65

9.6.
Interim Analyses
In Part A, there are 2 planned IAs at 35% and 70% of total target cases across the 2 treatment
groups. The primary objective of the IAs is for early detection of reliable evidence that VE is above
30%. The Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming approximation spending function is used for calculating
efficacy bounds and to preserve the (1-sided) 0.025 false positive error rate over the IAs and the
primary analysis (when the target number of cases have been observed), relative to the hypothesis:
H0efficacy: HR ≥0.7 (equivalently, proportional hazards VE ≤0.3).
There is no intention to stop the study early if the efficacy has been demonstrated at any of the
IAs. If efficacy is demonstrated at an IA, the subsequent IA or primary analysis will be considered
supportive in nature. The DSMB will review the IA results and make recommendations to the
Sponsor in terms of study results reporting and unblinding based on the boundaries of early
efficacy as described in this section, safety data, and data external to this study. In addition to
possible early efficacy at IAs, the DSMB will monitor for non-efficacy and vaccine harm; the
guiding principles (non-binding) is provided in Section 8.4.2, and the details will be provided in
the SAP.
Table 15 summarizes the timing, number of cases and decision guidance at each IA and primary
analysis.
The first IA will occur when approximately 35% of the total cases have been observed (across
both treatment groups). The study will be considered positive at the first IA if the p-value for
rejecting HR ≥0.7 is less than 0.0002 based on the Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming approximation
spending function. This corresponds to an observed HR of approximately 0.259, or an observed
VE approximately 0.741.
The second IA will occur when approximately 70% of the total cases have been observed. The
study will be considered positive (VE has been demonstrate) if the p-value for rejecting HR ≥0.7
is less than 0.0073 based on the Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming approximation spending function.
This corresponds to an observed HR of approximately 0.435, or an observed VE of approximately
0.565.

The primary analysis will be performed when approximately 151 cases have been observed in the
study. The study will be considered positive at the primary analysis if the 1-sided p-value for
rejecting HR ≥0.7 is less than 0.0227. This corresponds to an observed HR of approximately 0.505
or observed VE of approximately 0.495.

APPENDIX 1: Schedules of Events
If a participant cannot attend a study site visit (scheduled or unscheduled, with the exception of
Screening, Day 1, Day 29, PDV, OL-D1, OL-D29, and BD-1), a home visit is acceptable if
performed by appropriately delegated study site staff or a home healthcare service provided by the
Sponsor. If neither a participant visit to the study site nor a home visit to the participant is possible
(with the exception of Screening, Day 1, Day 29, PDV, OL-D1, OL-D29, and BD-1), a safety
phone call should be performed that includes the assessments scheduled for the biweekly safety
phone calls (Table 16).
The Supplemental SoEs (Table 21 and Table 23) and the Modified Supplemental SoE (Table 22)
are
intended
to
occur
in
addition
to
the
original
SoEs,
as
applicable
(Table 16,
Table 17Table 18Table 19), and therefore there is a possibility for study visits to overlap. If visits
overlap according to respective visit windows, a single visit may be completed with any duplicated
study procedures each completed once (refer to Table 4 footnotes for more detailed instructions
and exceptions).

Note: In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-19 Pandemic (DHHS 2020a), investigators may
convert study site visits to telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor. All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows.
If the participant is not able to come on-site for a study site visit as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (self-quarantine or disruption of study site activities
following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “stay at home” or “shelter in place”), a safety call to the participant should be made in
place of the study site visit. The safety call should encompass all scheduled visit assessments that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and
concomitant medications (eg, as defined in scheduled biweekly safety phone calls). Home visits will be permitted for all non-dosing visits except for Screening
if a participant cannot come to the study site as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
1.
Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined the same day. Additionally, the Day 0 visit may be performed over multiple visits if within the 28-day screening window.
2.
Physical examination: a full physical examination, including vital signs, height, and weight, will be performed at Screening and Day 1. Body mass index
will be calculated at the Screening Visit (Day 0) only. Symptom-directed physical examinations will be performed on Day 29 and Day 57. On each dosing
day before injection, the arm receiving the injection should be examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated. Any clinically significant
finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE. Vital signs are to be collected pre- and post-dosing on days of injection (Day 1 and
Day 29). When applicable, vital sign measurements should be performed before blood collection. Participants who are febrile (body temperature
≥38.0°C/100.4°F) before dosing on Day 1 or Day 29 must be rescheduled within the relevant window period to receive the injection. Afebrile participants
with minor illnesses can be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.
3.
Pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1 and before the second vaccination will be a point-of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator a pregnancy
test either via blood or point-of-care urine test can be performed. Follicle-stimulating hormone level may be measured to confirm menopausal status at the
discretion of the investigator.
4.
Participants with symptoms of COVID-19 will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site for an unscheduled visit, to include
an NP swab sample (for RT-PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not possible, a home visit may be arranged to collect the NP
swab sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possible, the participant will be asked to submit a saliva sample to the study site by a
Sponsor-approved method. At this visit, an NP swab and blood sample will be collected to evaluate for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. An additional
NP swab sample will be collected to test for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to
evaluate the severity of the clinical case. It is important to note that some of the symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with solicited systemic ARs that are
expected after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs
are common, investigators should use their clinical judgement to decide if an NP swab should be collected. The collection of an NP swab prior to the Day 1
and Day 29 vaccination can help ensure that cases of COVID-19 are not overlooked. Any study participant reporting respiratory symptoms during the 7-day
period after vaccination should be evaluated for COVID-19.
5.
Sample must be collected prior to dosing on days of injection (Day 1 and Day 29).
6.
The participant will record entries in the eDiary approximately 30 minutes after dosing while at the study site, with instruction provided by study staff. Study
participants will continue to record in the eDiary each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening, on the day of dosing and for 6 days
following. Any solicited AR that is ongoing beyond Day 7 will be reported until resolution. Adverse reactions recorded in eDiaries beyond Day 7 should be
reviewed either via phone call or at the following study visit. Participants will be given thermometers to record their temperatures and rulers to measure any
injection site reactions.
7.
Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any unsolicited AEs through Day 57 (including any signs and symptoms
of COVID-19), MAAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any non-study
vaccinations.
8.
All concomitant medications and non-study vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days after each injection; all concomitant medications relevant to or
for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Screening through the final visit (Day 759).

respiratory sample for SARS-CoV-2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical care for the study participant as determined by local standards of care.
Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.
4.
The eDiary Safety Follow-up prompts will be triggering off of Day 61 to take into consideration the (-3 day) window allowance at Day 29. This first Safety
Follow-Up prompt at Day 61 will follow the same 7-day surveillance per protocol.
5.
Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any sign/symptoms of COVID-19, MAAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to
withdrawal, SAEs, information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any non-study vaccinations.
6.
All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Screening through the final visit (Day 759).
7.
One additional ePRO prompt will be sent to participants specifically to solicit the collection of information regarding participant’s history of facial injections
or dermal fillers, for cosmetic or medical indications such as migraine headaches.

1.
Physical examination: a symptom-directed physical examination, including vital signs will be performed at the initial visit to confirm the diagnosis
(denoted as D1 in this table) and at the Convalescent Visit (28 days after diagnosis [D28 in this table]).
2.
Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any AEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, information on
concomitant medications associated with those events, and any non-study vaccinations. All safety events will be followed until resolution.
3.
All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Screening through the final visit (Day 759).
4.
Participants will have daily telemedicine visits (via video or phone) for 14 days (from the point of the Illness Visit or initial COVID-19 contact) or until
symptoms resolve, whichever is later, and which may include symptoms persisting longer than the 28-day Convalescent Period, with the exception of
mild loss of sense of taste/smell). If a participant is completely asymptomatic for 72 hours prior to Day 14, including normal oxygen saturation and
temperature, then telemedicine calls can be reduced to weekly; however, the participant should still report the daily symptoms at that contact. The
participant should also report their oxygen saturation and temperature measured on the day of the contact, but these need not be recorded daily during this
reduced frequency monitoring period. If a participant reports a change or recurrence of symptoms, daily telemedicine visits should be resumed to the daily
schedule. For these participants, a final telemedicine visit will occur on Day 14 to determine before symptom monitoring can be discontinued. If symptoms
persist after Day 60, then telemedicine calls can be reduced to weekly; however, the participant should still report the daily symptoms at that contact.
Telemedicine visits may be performed by medically qualified staff appropriately delegated by the investigator. During the telemedicine visit (preferably
done in the evening) the participant will be asked to verbally report the severity of each symptom and their highest body temperature and lowest oxygen
saturation for that day, and the investigator will determine if medical attention is required due to worsening of COVID-19. The participant will also be
reminded to collect a saliva sample and return it to the study site, on the appropriate days. Please note, the negative (-1 day) window allowance does not
apply to these daily telemedicine visits and if the +1 day window is used, the site should still collect symptoms from the participant for the previous day.
5.
Participants with symptoms of COVID-19 will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site or medically qualified staff from
the site will conduct a home visit as soon as possible to collect an NP swab sample (for RT-PCR) and collect a blood sample for immunologic assessment
of SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluate for COVID-19. An additional NP swab sample will also be tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens.
In addition, the study site may collect an additional (local/non-central) respiratory sample for SARS-CoV-2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical
care for the study participant as determined by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity
of the clinical case. If the RT-PCR test from the NP swab sample from the Illness Visit is negative for SARS-CoV-2, the participant will exit the
Convalescent Period and resume the study schedule (Table 16, Table 17, and Table 18).
6.
This can be a home visit if necessary.
7.
Participants will collect their own saliva sample using the saliva collection tubes provided on 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, and 21 days after the initial Illness Visit, and
return them to the study site according to Sponsor instructions. Participants who are pending a central laboratory RT-PCR may exit from the Convalescent
Period based on a negative RT-PCR result from a CLIA-certified or CLIA-certified waiver local laboratory at the investigator’s discretion.
8.
At this visit, a saliva sample will be collected.

1.
At the point when the mRNA-1273 vaccine is no longer available for study use, any participant who schedules a PDV after this timepoint will be unblinded
(with no option to stay blinded), but will not be offered mRNA-1273 study vaccine.
2.
All participants are counselled about the importance of continuing other public health measures to limit the spread of disease including physical-social
distancing, wearing a mask, and hand-washing.
3.
The Supplemental and the Modified Supplemental Schedule of Events are intended to occur in addition to the original schedules of events, as applicable
(Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, and Table 19) and therefore there is a possibility for study visits to overlap. If visits overlap according to respective visit

Note: In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-19 Pandemic (DHHS 2020a), investigators may
convert study site visits to telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor. All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows.
If the participant is not able to come on-site for a study site visit as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (self-quarantine or disruption of study site activities
following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “stay at home” or “shelter in place”), a safety call to the participant should be made in
place of the study site visit. The safety call should encompass all scheduled visit assessments that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and

concomitant medications (eg, as defined in scheduled biweekly safety phone calls). Home visits will be permitted for all non-dosing visits except for Screening
if a participant cannot come to the study site as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
4.
The Day 0 and OL-D1 visit may be performed on 2 separate visits.
5.
Symptom-directed physical examination will be performed at the PDV and on OL-D29. On each dosing day before injection, the arm receiving the
injection should be examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should
be reported as an MAAE. Vital signs are to be collected pre- and post-dosing on days of injection (OL-D1 and OL-D29). Participants who are febrile
(body temperature ≥38.0°C/100.4°F) before dosing (OL-D1 and OL-D29) must be rescheduled within the relevant window period to receive the injection.
Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.
6.
Pregnancy test at the PDV and OL-D29 will be a point-of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or point-of-
care urine test can be performed. Follicle-stimulating hormone level may be measured to confirm menopausal status at the discretion of the investigator.
7.
Participants with symptoms of COVID-19 will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site for an unscheduled visit, to
include an NP swab sample (for RT-PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not possible, a home visit may be arranged to collect
the NP sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possible, the participant will be asked to submit a saliva sample to the study site by
a Sponsor-approved method. At this visit, an NP swab and blood sample will be collected to evaluate for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. An
additional NP swab sample will be collected to test for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. In addition, the study site may collect an additional
(local/non-central) respiratory sample for SARS-CoV-2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical care for the study participant as determined by
local standards of care. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case. It is important to note that
some of the symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with solicited systemic ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (eg, myalgia, headache,
fever, and chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, investigators should use their clinical judgement to
decide if an NP swab should be collected. The collection of an NP swab prior to the PDV can help ensure that cases of COVID-19 are not overlooked.
Any study participant reporting respiratory symptoms during the 7-day period after vaccination should be evaluated for COVID-19.
8.
Sample must be collected prior to unblinding and injection at the PDV.
9.
Post-dosing, participants will have a 30-minute observation period.
10.
Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any MAAEs (including any signs and symptoms of COVID-19), AESIs,
AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any non-study vaccinations.
11.
All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Screening through the final visit (Day 759).

APPENDIX 2: Study Governance Considerations
11.2.1.
Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following:
•
Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the
Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences
International Ethical Guidelines.
•
Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines.
•
Applicable laws and regulatory requirements.
•
The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, Investigator Brochure, and other relevant
documents (eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB/IEC by the investigator and
reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC before the study is initiated.
•
Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/IEC approval before implementation of
changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an
immediate hazard to study participants.
•
The investigator will be responsible for the following:
−
Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC annually or more
frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the
IRB/IEC
−
Notifying the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by IRB/IEC
procedures
−
Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to requirements of
21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB/IEC, European regulation 536/2014 for clinical studies (if
applicable), and all other applicable local regulations.
11.2.2.
Study Monitoring
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Moderna or
its representatives will visit the investigational study site to:
•
Determine the adequacy of the facilities.
•
Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Moderna or its representatives. This will
be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Moderna, designated CRO, and
the investigator.

According to ICH GCP guideline, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the proper
conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on the eCRFs.
The study monitor’s duties are to aid the investigator and Moderna in the maintenance of complete,
accurate, legible, well-organized, and easily retrievable data. The study monitor will advise the
investigator of the regulatory necessity for study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and
inspection by providing direct access to the source data/documents. In addition, the study monitor
will explain to and interpret for the investigator all regulations applicable to the clinical evaluation
of an IP as documented in ICH guidelines.
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation throughout
the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; to verify
completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study conduct
to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the Clinical Monitoring Plan. During the study,
a monitor from Moderna or a representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site,
for the following:
•
Provide information and support to the investigator(s).
•
Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.
•
Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are being
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being performed.
•
Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs
with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each
participant (eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).
•
Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent.
•
Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any
SAEs have been forwarded to the SAE Hotline, and those SAEs that met criteria for
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB/IEC.
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information
or advice.
In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the
COVID-19 Pandemic (DHHS 2020a), investigators may convert study site visits to telemedicine
visits with the approval of the Sponsor (Section 8 for Procedures).
The DSMB will also have responsibility for safety monitoring (Section 8.4.2).

Audits and Inspections
Moderna, their designee(s), the IRB/IEC, or regulatory authorities will be allowed to conduct site
visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring or inspecting any aspect of the
study. The investigator agrees to allow Moderna, their designee(s), the IRB/IEC, or regulatory
authorities to inspect the IP storage area, IP stocks, IP records, participant charts and study source
documents, and other records relative to study conduct.
Authorized representatives of Moderna, a regulatory authority, and any IRB/IEC may visit the site
to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a Sponsor audit
or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded,
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH GCP E6R2, and any applicable
regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact Moderna immediately if contacted by a
regulatory agency about an inspection.
The Principal Investigator must obtain IRB approval for the investigation. Initial IRB approval,
and all materials approved by the IRB for this study including the participant consent form and
recruitment materials must be maintained by the investigator and made available for inspection.
11.2.4.
Financial Disclosure
The investigator is required to provide financial disclosure information to allow the Sponsor to
submit the complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements required under 21 CFR 54.
In addition, the investigator must provide the Sponsor with a commitment to promptly update this
information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for 1 year
following the completion of the study.
The Sponsor, the CRO, and the study site are not financially responsible for further testing or
treatment of any medical condition that may be detected during the screening process. In addition,
in the absence of specific arrangements, the Sponsor, the CRO, and the study site are not
financially responsible for further treatment of the disease under study.
11.2.5.
Recruitment Procedures
Advertisements to be used for the recruitment of study participants, and any other written
information regarding this study to be provided to the participant should be submitted to the
Sponsor for approval. All documents must be approved by the IRB.

Sample Retention and Future Biomedical Research
The retention period of laboratory samples will be 15 years, or as permitted by local regulations,
to address further scientific questions related to mRNA-1273 or anti-respiratory virus immune
response. In addition, identifiable samples can be destroyed at any time at the request of the
participant. During the study, or during the retention period, in addition to the analysis outlined in
the study endpoints, exploratory analysis may be conducted, using other Ab-based methodologies,
on any remaining blood or serum samples, including participants who provide samples for
screening, but are not subsequently enrolled. These analyses would extend the search for other
potentially relevant biomarkers to investigate the effect of mRNA-1273, as well as to determine
how changes in the markers may relate to exposure and clinical outcomes. A decision to perform
such exploratory research may arise from new scientific findings related to the drug class or
disease, as well as reagent and assay availability.

APPENDIX 3: Contraceptive Guidance
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
Females of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg,
amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before first dose
of study treatment, additional evaluation should be considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
1. Premenarchal
2. Premenopausal, surgically sterile female with 1 of the following:
a.
Documented complete hysterectomy
b. Documented bilateral salpingectomy
c.
Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above,
(eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied in
determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s medical
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
3. Postmenopausal female
•
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:
o
Women < 50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and FSH levels in the
postmenopausal range for the institution.
o
Women ≥50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been
amenorrheic for 12 months or more, had radiation-induced menopause with last
menses > 1 year ago or had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses
> 1 year ago.
•
A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal
state in women not using hormonal replacement therapy (HRT).
•
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to

APPENDIX 5: Adverse Events of Special Interest Terms
The Investigator’s medical judgement must be applied to assess an event as an AESI, as
most AESIs are based on medical concepts. Table 27 below does not provide a
comprehensive list of terms.
Table 27 describes events/medical concepts that are of interest in COVID-19 vaccine safety
surveillance. Some are specific to vaccines; however, some are of interest due to their occurrence
in the context of concurrent or recent COVID-19. Events that occur in Part C (after participants
receive a booster dose) and fall into the descriptions below should be reported as AESIs, per the
reporting processes specified in Section 8.3.3, even when they occur during/following COVID-
19 infection.
Please note: COVID-19 itself is not an AESI.

Amendment 9, 10 Sep 2021
Main Rationale for the Amendment:
1. To provide a 50 µg BD of mRNA-1273 to participants. This change is prompted by the
announcement by the President of the US that, as of 20 Sep 2021, certain individuals will
be eligible to receive a BD in addition to the prior receipt of a primary vaccine regimen
with mRNA-1273. The interim results of an ongoing Moderna Phase 2 study
(mRNA-1273-P201), in which participants who 6 to 8 months prior received 2 doses of

COVID-19. Additionally, no new safety signals emerged upon administration of the BD in
Study mRNA-1273-P201. Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit-risk profile of a BD
of mRNA-1273 is favorable, particularly in light of increasing breakthrough disease with
the emergence of the Delta variant. The details of eligibility for BDs provided by the US
federal government have not been specified as of the time of writing this protocol
amendment. Providing the option for a BD to all federally eligible participants currently
enrolled in Part B is expected to promote retention of participants in the ongoing study and
thereby defend the scientific integrity of the study for the planned 2-year duration of
follow-up after the completion of the primary vaccination series.
2. To provide guidance to the investigators regarding assessing and reporting AESIs,
including myocarditis and pericarditis, for this study population.

Amendment 8, 23 Mar 2021
Main Rationale for the Amendment:
The purpose of this amendment is to update language around unblinding and open-label dosing in
the context of the majority of participants already having completed their blinded follow-up. In
addition, the amendment updates the reporting of serious COVID-19 cases.
The summary of changes table provided here describes the major changes made in Amendment 8
relative to Amendment 7, including the sections modified and the corresponding rationales. As
applicable, the synopsis of Amendment 8 has been modified to correspond to changes in the body

mRNA-1273
Confidential
Page 182
Section # and Name
Description of Change
Brief Rationale
Section 4.1.2 (Part B, the Open-Label
Observational Phase)
States that, due to ethical and
scientific concerns, all
participants will be unblinded
once investigational product is no
longer available. In addition, the
text indicates that if participants
want to receive Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA) vaccine
outside of the study, participants
will need to be withdrawn from
the study.
The amendment also provides
directions for unblinding after
Biologics License Application
(BLA) database lock.
At the time of this amendment,
more than 95% of the enrolled
participants have completed
blinded follow-up, either
through being unblinded or
study discontinuation.
Therefore, there is no scientific
value for participants to remain
blinded.
In addition, non-study EUA
vaccines are widely available,
so ethically, participants should
be unblinded to ensure they can
make an informed choice if
they wish to receive EUA
COVID-19 vaccine outside of
the study.
Section 8.3.7 (Time Period and Frequency
for collecting Adverse Events and Serious
Adverse Event Information) and Section
8.3.10 (Reporting Adverse Events)
Reporting of only serious
COVID-19 cases within 24 hours
to Sponsor or it's designee.
Nonserious COVID-19 cases
are an efficacy endpoint, so
reporting to Pharmacovigilance
is no longer warranted.
Amendment 7, 10 Feb 2021
Main Rationale for the Amendment:
The purpose of this amendment is to collect safety information on suspected cases of anaphylaxis
and to include participant history of facial injections or dermal fillers in the eDiary.
The summary of changes table provided here describes the major changes made in Amendment 7
relative to Amendment 6, including the sections modified and the corresponding rationales. The
